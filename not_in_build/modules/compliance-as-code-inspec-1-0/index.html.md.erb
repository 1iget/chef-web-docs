InSpec is an open-source testing framework with a human-readable language for specifying compliance, security and other policy requirements. Just as Chef treats infrastructure as code, InSpec treats compliance as code. The shift away from having people act directly on machines to having people act on code means that compliance testing becomes automated, repeatable, and versionable.

In this webinar, we explore how InSpec can improve compliance across your applications and infrastructure.
