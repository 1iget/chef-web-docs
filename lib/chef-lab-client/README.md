# Chef Lab Client

Browser client for [Chef Lab](https://github.com/opscode/cheflab).

## Development

* `npm install`: Install dependencies
* `npm test`: Run the tests
* `npm run build`: Build the JavaScript file
* `npm run watch`: Watch tests and build

An example of using the app is in the example directory.

The build creates chef-lab-client.js, which should be committed and is symlinked
in the source/assets/javascripts directory of learn-chef and the example directory.
