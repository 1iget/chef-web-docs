# Additional resources

Here are some additional resources to help guide you on your journey to learning Chef.

## Chef reference documentation

[docs.opscode.com](http://docs.opscode.com) is a great companion to the tutorials you'll find on learnchef.com. Add it to your bookmarks so that you can quickly access more detailed info when you need it.

## Learn Ruby

The tutorials on learnchef.com provide all the Ruby code that you need to get started. We recommend that you also check out [Just Enough Ruby for Chef](http://docs.opscode.com/just_enough_ruby_for_chef.html) to learn more about the fundamentals of Ruby programming. 

## Chef Fundamentals Webinar Series

Join Chef community manager [Nathen Harvey](http://twitter.com/nathenharvey) as he covers the fundamentals of using Chef in these recorded screencasts. 

Each unit contains hands-on exercises to reinforce the material. You will learn Chef by using it. By the end of the series, you'll have a code repository that you can use and adapt to solve real business problems.

Each session lasts about one hour.

  * Week 1 - [Overview of Chef](/screencasts/fundi-webinar-week-1/)
