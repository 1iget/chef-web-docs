Welcome! If you’re new to Chef, this article is for you. We’ll talk about how to get started, what to do first and where to go next.

What you do first really depends on what you want. Are you more interested in the business value of DevOps and automation? Do you want to get hands-on with the technology as quickly as possible? Are you already familiar with Chef and want to broaden your skills? No matter your goal, we have the resources.

## Resources available to you

The [Learn Chef] (/) site is the hub of Chef-related resources for building your skills. On this site, you’ll find links to five primary resources:

<img style="max-width:75%;" src="/skills/how-to-learn-chef/images/learn-chef-io.png"/>

Our Learn Chef [tutorials](/tutorials) get you started quickly. You’ll learn the basics, move on to managing a node, get started with local development, and then tackle more advanced topics. The tutorials are definitely the starting point for most people who want a hands-on approach.

The Chef [Skills Library](/skills) is a diverse collection of articles that deepen your understanding of DevOps, Chef patterns, and best practices. You can learn about becoming a DevOps practitioner or find out how to secure your Chef installation.

Chef has a complete set of [reference docs](https://docs.chef.io). For example, if you're writing a cookbook and need to learn about a particular resource, you'll find it here. Chef docs also include conceptual overviews of each of our products.

If you want a more personal approach, Chef offers [training classes](https://training.chef.io/) led by a team of experienced instructors. You can attend in person or join one of our live online sessions. We also have a certification program that offers different levels of accreditation.

The Chef [community site](/community) is home to a diverse group of practitioners who are dedicated to helping others become successful with Chef and DevOps. From meet-ups to podcasts run and created by community members, there are multiple ways to engage, contribute, share, and learn from others.

In addition, Chef’s home page, [www.chef.io](https://www.chef.io), has links to helpful overview material as well as information about webinars, meet-ups, events and more.

Chef also offers professional services that can get you started fast and help with the planning and design of your Chef and Chef Automate installation.

If you want more guidance, feel free to talk to us. Use the "Contact Us" box at the bottom of [this page](https://www.chef.io). We’d be happy to answer your questions and get you connected to the resources you need.

## Roadmap

There are three main phases to learning Chef:

* _How to manage a node_. To get started, you need to learn basics of infrastructure as code, for example, how to manage a server using Chef.
* _Local development_. Chef supports test environments on your local workstation so that you can validate your updates to infrastructure before sharing them with others or rolling out to production environments. To become proficient, you'll need to learn how to do this.
* _Continuous deployment_. Chef is most often used in a team environment. Learning how to work in a team environment is an important part of the journey to DevOps.

Chef has learning resources for each of these phases of skills development. See "Getting started fast", "Learning local development", and "Skills for a team-oriented environment" below.

## Getting started fast

Learn how to turn infrastructure into code with Chef.

For hands-on experience, try these tutorials:

* [Learn the Chef basics](/tutorials/learn-the-basics)
* [Manage a node](/tutorials/manage-a-node)

Although Chef [runs on many platforms](https://docs.chef.io/platforms.html), we provide a version of each tutorial that's tailored for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Windows Server, and Ubuntu to give you a sense of how Chef applies to each of these common server environments.

In the first tutorial, _Learn the Chef basics_, the free virtual machine option is the fastest way to get started. In the second tutorial, _Manage a node_, Hosted Chef is an easy way to get started. After you complete these tutorials, you can work through them a second time on your own infrastructure to see how Chef runs in your environment.

Once you have a hang of the basics, you can:

* Sign up for a [Chef Essentials](https://training.chef.io/category/in-person-training) training class
* Watch some of the videos in the Joy of Automating section of the [Skills Library](/skills)
* Browse the Chef [reference documentation](https://docs.chef.io)

For hands-on experience, try these tutorials:

* [Get started with Test Kitchen](/local-development)
* [Develop a web app cookbook](/manage-a-web-app)
* [Getting started with automated testing](/skills/get-started-with-testing/)

## Skills for a team-oriented environment

Chef Automate enables multiple teams to work together to deploy software. With Chef Automate, you can integrate security and policy testing into the Chef Automate pipeline and have visibility into everything that's happening to your infrastructure.
