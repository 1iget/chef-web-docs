## Option 1: Use the Chef training lab

The easiest and recommended way to complete the exercises is to [launch the Chef training lab][launch-training-lab].

Here's what happens next:

After [launching the Chef training lab][launch-training-lab], you will be taken to a registration page for CloudShare (the virtual training lab platform we are working with).

Once the sign up form is completed you will enter the environment. The status bar at the top will let you know that a VM is being provisioned for you.

Once provisioned, the **Start Using This Environment** button will light up. Click it.

![start using environment](/assets/images/quickstart/nodes/cloud-share/centos-start-environment.png)

You will see a CentOS 6.3 Server VM listed in the window. Click **More details** to get the required information about this VM.

Write down the **External Address** for the VM and click **show password** to display the SSH user's password.

Write down the **Username** and **Password** that are displayed.

You should now have the following details about your Chef training lab:

* External address
* SSH username
* SSH password
