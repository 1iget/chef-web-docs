## Validate and refine your roadmap

In general, after you validate the roadmap with customers, your themes should hold, your outcomes may or may not hold, and the features will shift all the time.

Be suspicious if, working backwards, your features don't change but your outcomes and your themes are no longer true. You're prioritizing features over the actual goals of your roadmap.

As you refine your roadmap, remember that identifying what customers need is just one step toward building products customers love. Think about including features that fulfill a variety of customer expectations. (Note that the following discussion of features is a simplification of the [Kano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_model) model.)

Some features customers need are so basic, they're taken for granted. However, if they're not there, customers are very unhappy.

The next set of features to include are those that customers notice. They're happy if the features work and unhappy if they don't.

However, to make customers truly love your product, include "delighters." Customers don't expect to see these features, and are delighted when they are a part of the product.

Finally, remember that the best way to create a great roadmap is to get feedback from a wide variety of people within your company as well as a broad range of customers.
