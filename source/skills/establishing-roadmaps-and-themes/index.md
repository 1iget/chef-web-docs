To begin, every product needs a strong value proposition. In other words, it should be a product that people will love. Liking a product isn't enough. Start by focusing on what customers need, not on what they want. While it can be tricky to distinguish between _want_ and _need_, use consensus as a guide. A single customer might be adamant about needing a feature but if none of your other customers ask for it, it's probably a feature that only the particular customer wants. If you have fifty customers asking for a feature, it's something your customers need.
