##What's Next

Along with migrating the rest of their infrastructure to Red Hat Linux and Chef, one of the team's priorities is to increase the number of customers who are in charge of their own deployments. Brian says, "We already have customers who can push the deployment button but they're so close to our team they understand how things work. Now we're broadening out to the rest of our customer base."

Of course, there's no lack of things to do. Brian says, "We're always going to be iterating and improving. We're still trying to figure out how to get all our customers on board, and still build everything repeatedly and easily. Let me put it this way, our backlog is growing, not shrinking."
