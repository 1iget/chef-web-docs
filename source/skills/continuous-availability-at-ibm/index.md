IBM sponsors many well-known sporting events, such as the [US Open](http://www.usopen.org/index.html) and the [Wimbledon Championships](http://www.wimbledon.com/index.html). The IBM Continuous Availability Services â€“ Events Infrastructure (CAS-EI) is the team that operates and manages the very popular web sites for these events. For example, during this year's Wimbledon Championships, the team delivered half-a-billion page views during the two-week tournament.

In this article, IBM CAS-EI members Brian O'Connell and Rich Bogdany talk about what it means to run the cloud that supports these very visible sites. Brian is a Senior Technical Staff Member and has been at IBM since 2001. His focus is on the development side. His counterpart, Rich, is a software engineer whose focus in on the infrastructure side. He's been at IBM since 1989.

Brian set the stage by describing the team's two overriding concerns. "Our focus is on continuous availability. You should always be able to get to our web sites. Continuous availability is the lens by which we examine all our technical decisions.

"Also, our business is different from most because we have hard deadlines. Things don't slip for us. A lot of our priorities are driven by that fact. You can't push back and say, 'Sorry, you'll have to move the US Open to a couple days later.' That doesn't work. I've tried."
