Chef Automate manages changes to both infrastructure and application code, giving your operations and development teams a common platform for developing, building, testing, and deploying cookbooks, applications, and more.

Chef Automate is team oriented. It enables multiple teams to work together to deploy software. With Chef Automate, you can integrate security and policy testing into the Chef Automate pipeline and have visibility into everything that's happening to your infrastructure.

Here's a short video that introduces Chef Automate and its components.

## Getting started with Chef

If you're new to Chef, read [How to learn Chef](/skills/how-to-learn-chef/) to learn how to get started, what to do first and where to go next.

Before you approach Chef Automate, we recommend first working through these 3 tutorials.

* [Learn the Chef basics](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/)
* [Manage a node](/tutorials/manage-a-node/)
* [Develop locally](/tutorials/local-development/)

In these tutorials, you'll learn how:

* Chef's _test and repair_ approach keeps your systems in line with the policies you describe.
* _cookbooks_, _receipes_, and _resources_ enable you to express your configuration policy through code.
* the Chef server acts as a central repository for your cookbooks and for information about your servers, or _nodes_.
* the Chef Development Kit (Chef DK) enables you to develop cookbooks, test them locally, and administer your network, all from your workstation.

Although Chef [runs on many platforms](https://docs.chef.io/platforms.html), each tutorial provides content for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Windows Server, and Ubuntu to give you a sense of how Chef applies to each of these common server environments.

In the first tutorial, _Learn the Chef basics_, the free virtual machine option is the fastest way to get started. In the second tutorial, _Manage a node_, Hosted Chef is an easy way to get started. After you complete these tutorials, you can work through them a second time on your own infrastructure to see how Chef runs in your environment.

## Getting started with Chef Automate

Chef Automate has three main components &ndash; [workflow](https://docs.chef.io/workflow.html), [visibility](https://docs.chef.io/visibility.html), and [compliance](https://docs.chef.io/compliance.html). Here are resources to help you get started with each of them.

## Visibility

Working with Chef Automate's visibility feature is a great way to get started. When Chef runs on your nodes, Chef Automate collects data about the run. Chef Automate's visibility feature enables you to monitor and visualize the status of your nodes and other events from the Chef server.

The _Manage a node_ tutorial can help you get started. In this tutorial, you'll use Chef Automate's visibility feature to visualize the status of your node and resolved a failed Chef run. Choose the version of this tutorial that most closely matches the kind of servers you typically manage.

* [Manage a Red Hat Enterprise Linux node using Chef Automate](/tutorials/manage-a-node/rhel/automate/)
* [Manage a Windows Server node using Chef Automate](/tutorials/manage-a-node/windows/automate/)
* [Manage an Ubuntu node using Chef Automate](/tutorials/manage-a-node/ubuntu/automate/)

### Workflow

The next step is to learn about Chef Automate's workflow feature. This feature uses pipelines to enable multiple teams to work together to deploy software. For hands-on experience, try the [Chef Automate tutorials](/automate). In the tutorials, you'll run a CloudFormation template to set up your own Chef Automate cluster on AWS and deliver a sample application through Chef Automate's pipeline.

### Compliance

If you're interested in using Chef to help achieve your compliance goals, check out the [Scan for compliance](/tutorials/compliance-assess/) and [Remediate compliance failures](/tutorials/compliance-remediate/) tutorials. In these tutorials, you'll learn how the Chef compliance scanner enables you to assess your infrastructure's adherence to compliance requirements and how to use local development to remediate compliance failures.

In these tutorials you'll work with the Chef compliance standalone scanner, but you can also integrate compliance testing with Chef Automate's visibility and workflow features. We're working on Learn Chef tutorials to help get you started. In the meantime, you can [read the documentation](https://docs.chef.io/integrate_compliance_chef_server.html) to understand what's involved.
