## Story

As we learned in the last section the complexity of creating a restaurant and a modern application have quite a few similiarities because of the overral goal of handling requests from our users, processing those requests, and in return give them what it is they need to be satisfied.

To satisfy more customers within a restaurant or an application it became important to define multiple, distinct roles. Each role performs a specialized operation that is important to the entire process. The work that each role is important to accomplish our goal.

If we think again about us setting up a restaurant we think about the entire experience from when the customer comes through the door until they leave out that same door. To ensure we create the right experience we define roles to ensure that individuals are greeted, their orders are taken, their drinks and additional requests are handled, their food is created, and that they can pay you for that food or service.

As the restaurant owner you have to define for each role:

* the work they perform
* their required tools
* how they communicate information to others in the system
* their required qualifications
* the skills they will need to learn
* how many will perform in this role


This is similar 


The role of each system defines:

* the required computing power
* the software that is installed
* how the software is configured
* its ability to be accessed (externally by customers or internally by other systems)
* its ability to access other systems
