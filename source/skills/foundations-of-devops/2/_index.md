## DevOps is both a cultural and a professional movement

A definition that describes DevOps as a whole is that it is a cultural and professional movement, focused on how we build and operate high velocity organizations, born from the experience of its practitioners. Breaking this definition down into its components:

* DevOps is a cultural and professional movement, just like heavy metal or hip hop is a culture, or [otaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Otaku). It's also a professional movement, just as lead guitarist, MC, or animator are professions within their respective cultures.
*  DevOps is about building high-velocity organizations. Everyone who practices DevOps is doing it to create these types of companies.
*  DevOps is born from the experiences of its practitioners. Although many people assume that the original DevOps practitioners were web innovators, that's not necessarily true. What does matter is that DevOps practitioners are alway honing their skills and looking for ways to improve.
