## The first principle of a DevOps practice

There are several principles that mark someone's practice as a DevOps practice. The first principle is that:

**DevOps practitioners design products for the safety, contentment, knowledge and freedom of their peers and their customers.**

### Safety
Safety can mean human safety, it can mean safety of information. It can also have a broader meaning, which is the ability of individuals to act without fear of unintended consequences. DevOps builds organizations where people can express themselves without getting hurt.

### Contentment
Contentment means being satisfied with the things you have. Constant happiness is not a realistic goal for a DevOps practice. You will always have bad days. Contentment is a realistic goal. If you feel good about the people you work with, the systems you're building, and the outcomes you expect, you can achieve contentment. Even on bad days, you'll have a community of people you can rely on to help you get through.

### Knowledge
Access to knowledge is a leading indicator of social progress. The goal isn't to minimize the amount of knowledge you need. The goal is to make sure people can access the knowledge they need when they need it. For example, can your engineers see the revenue the company generates and why? If they can't, how can they even begin to understand what products and features will improve the business?

### Freedom
Freedom is the power to act or speak or think without hindrance or restraint. DevOps empowers people to act. DevOps  means that you trust the people in your organization, no matter what their job, and give them the freedom to do what they know best.

### People over products
A final marker of DevOps practitioners is that they put people over products and companies. DevOps practitioners, when they talk about what they're doing and why they're doing it, talk about people before they talk about the company or the products the company makes. DevOps practice prioritizes the human beings who are doing the work.
