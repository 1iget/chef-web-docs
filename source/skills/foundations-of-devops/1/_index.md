## A DevOps practice is easy to recognize

An example of such a practice is kungfu. The name _kungfu_ does not denote fighting. Instead, _kung_ can be translated as _work_ or _achievement_ or _merit_. The word _fu_ means _man_, but can be taken in the sense of _human_. Translated, _kungfu_ means excellence achieved through long practice of one's skills.

Even though there are many schools of kungfu, someone who practices it is easy to recognize. The same is true of DevOps. Although there are many _schools_ of DevOps, there are some underlying principles that comprise the foundation for all of them.
