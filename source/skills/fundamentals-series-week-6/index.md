## Before you begin

As part of this series, we provided a free online virtual machine to help you follow along with the training materials. We're in the process of migrating to a new platform for our online training environments.

This series still has a ton of great information that is fundamental to the way Chef works. So in the meantime, youâ€™ll either need to provide your own virtual machine or simply skip the exercises and watch as we demonstrate them during the videos.

If you choose to bring up your own environment, launch a CentOS 6 virtual machine or server that has:

* 512 MB RAM.
* 8 GB disk space.
* a user account with `sudo` or root access.
* an IP address that you can access from another workstation computer.

Be sure to [watch the Chef blog for updates](http://blog.chef.io) on when the new training environment will be available.
