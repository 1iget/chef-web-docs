## A DevOps practice is easy to recognize

An example of such a practice is kung fu. The name "kung fu" does not denote fighting. Instead, "kung" can be translated as "work" or "achievement" or "merit." The word "fu" means "man," but can be taken in the sense of "human." Translated, "kung fu" means excellence achieved through long practice of one's skills.

Even though there are many schools of kung fu, someone who practices it is easy to recognize. The same is true of DevOps. Although there are many "schools" of DevOps, there are some underlying principles that comprise the foundation for all of them.
