In this lesson, you'll:

* install Chef server on your hardware or cloud instance.
* ensure your Chef server configuration file includes your server's public hostname.
* start the server.
* install the management console and reporting features.
* create an administrator user and an organization.
* ensure your workstation has all the files that it needs to communicate with Chef server.
* verify that you can connect to Chef server from your workstation.

[COMMENT] We use `sudo` to highlight where root access is required. You can omit `sudo` from the commands if you're running as the root user.
