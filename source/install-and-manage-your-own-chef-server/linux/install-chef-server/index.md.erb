Now that you've performed the prerequisite tasks, you're ready to install and configure Chef server.

The easiest way to get started with your own Chef server is to launch a fully-functional Amazon Machine Images (AMI) for the Chef server from the AWS Marketplace or get Chef server from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace.

You can also install Chef server manually on your own hardware or on another cloud provider.
