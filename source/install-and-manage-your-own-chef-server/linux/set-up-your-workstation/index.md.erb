To work with Chef server, you'll need to set up these components on your workstation:

* The Chef DK
* A programmer's text editor
* A directory to work from
* An SSH client if you plan to manage Linux servers from a Windows workstation

If you haven't gone through the _Learn to manage a node_ tutorial, refer to these pages to learn how to get set up. Choose the version that matches the server platform you want to manage.

* [Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS](/manage-a-node/rhel/get-set-up)
* [Windows Server](/manage-a-node/windows/get-set-up)
* [Ubuntu](/manage-a-node/ubuntu/get-set-up)
