The Chef management console is the web-based interface into Chef server. You may not need it for large node deployments, but it's a great way to get started with Chef server because it enables you to interact with nodes and understand how Chef server works. The management console also installs prerequisites that Chef Analytics and other features require.

[COMMENT] We use `sudo` to highlight where root access is required. You can omit `sudo` from the commands if you're running as the root user.
