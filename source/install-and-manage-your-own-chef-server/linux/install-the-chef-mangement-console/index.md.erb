Although the management console is an optional component, installing it shows you how to add additional features to your Chef server. Plus, the management console is required by Chef Analytics and other features.

You use the following format to install Chef server features.

```bash
# ~
$ chef-server-ctl install <feature-name> (options)
```

[COMMENT] We use `sudo` to highlight where root access is required. You can omit `sudo` from the commands if you're running as the root user.
