[HEADLINE] The process to bootstrap and manage a node with your own Chef server is very similar to how you work with hosted Chef.

Now let's put your Chef server to work by managing a node. In this lesson, you'll:

* create a basic cookbook and upload that cookbook to your Chef server.
* bootstrap a node to your Chef server and apply your cookbook.
* confirm that the file was written as expected on your node.
