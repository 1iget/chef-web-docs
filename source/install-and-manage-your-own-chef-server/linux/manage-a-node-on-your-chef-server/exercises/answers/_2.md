When `chef-client` runs on your node, it checks in with the Chef server to get information about the node along with any newer cookbooks. Chef server uses a digital certificate to verify its authenticity. `chef-client` uses an RSA private key to verify the node's identity.

When you set up Chef server, you created an initial organization, which groups together users, nodes, and other related objects. When the organization is created, Chef server generates a shared RSA private key (which is different than the RSA key that you use to authenticate `knife` commands) that enables a node to validate itself when it communicates with the Chef server for the first time.

During the bootstrap process, `knife` copies this private key from the Chef server to the node. After the node perform the initial validation, it then retrieves a new key that only that only it can use. It's a common practice to use the [chef-client cookbook](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/chef-client) to delete the shared validation key from the node after the bootstrap process successfully completes.

You used the `knife ssl fetch` command to download this certificate to your workstation. During the bootstrap process, `knife` also copies this certificate to your node so that the node can validate the authenticity of the Chef server.
