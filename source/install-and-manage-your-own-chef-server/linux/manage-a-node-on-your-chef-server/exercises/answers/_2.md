When `chef-client` runs on your node, it checks in with the Chef server to get information about the node along with any newer cookbooks. Chef server uses a digital certificate to verify its authenticity. `chef-client` uses an RSA private key to verify the node's identity.

When you set up Chef server, you created an initial organization, which groups together users, nodes, and other related objects. When the organization is created, Chef server generates a shared RSA private key that enables a node to validate itself when it communicates with the Chef server for the first time.

During the bootstrap process, `knife` copies this private key from the Chef server to the node. After the node performs the initial validation, it then retrieves a new key that only it can use. It's a recommended practice to delete the shared validation key from the node after the bootstrap process successfully completes. The [chef-client cookbook](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/chef-client) is a popular way to do this.
