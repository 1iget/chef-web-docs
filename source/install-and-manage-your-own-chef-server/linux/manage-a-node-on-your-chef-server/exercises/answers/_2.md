When `chef-client` runs on your node, it checks in with the Chef server to get information about the node along with any newer cookbooks. Chef server uses a digital certificate to verify its authenticity. `chef-client` uses an RSA private key to verify the node's identity.

When you set up Chef server, you created an initial organization, which groups together users, nodes, and other related objects. You also copied the RSA private key that enables nodes to authenticate themselves when they communicate with the Chef server for the first time.

During the bootstrap process, a node uses this private key to authenticate with the Chef server, and then retrieves a new key that only that node can access. It's a common practice to delete the shared validation key from the node after the bootstrap process successfully completes.

You used the `knife ssl fetch` command to download this certificate to your workstation. During the bootstrap process, `knife` copies this certificate to your node.
