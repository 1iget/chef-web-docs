Each Chef server user has an RSA public/private key pair that authenticates every call to the Chef server. The `knife` configuration file, <code class="file-path">knife.rb</code>, points to the private component of the RSA keypair.

When you manage your own Chef server, you need to first create an admin user. Then you manually create the `knife` configuration file and copy the RSA key to your workstation. You can then create an additional user in the same way, or use the Chef management console to create a user and obtain the Starter Kit, like you did when you signed up for hosted Chef.
