`knife` is the command that enables you to communicate with the Chef server from your workstation. Each Chef server user has an RSA public/private key pair that authenticates every call to the Chef server. The `knife` configuration file, <code class="file-path">knife.rb</code>, points to the private component of the RSA keypair.

When you use hosted Chef, you download the Starter Kit, which contains the `knife` configuration file and RSA private key.

When you manage your own Chef server, you need to first create an admin user. Then you manually create the `knife` configuration file and copy the RSA key to your workstation. You can then create an additional user in the same way, or use the Chef management console to create a user and obtain the Starter Kit.
