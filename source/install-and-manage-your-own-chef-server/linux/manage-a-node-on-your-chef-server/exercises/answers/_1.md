Each Chef server user has an RSA public/private key pair that authenticates every call to the Chef server. The `knife` configuration file, <code class="file-path">knife.rb</code>, points to the private component of the RSA keypair.

This authentication mechanism ensures that the Chef server responds only to requests made by trusted users.
