Now that you've performed the prerequisite tasks, you're ready to install and configure Chef server on your system.

In this lesson, you'll:

* install Chef server.
* ensure your Chef server configuration file includes your server's public hostname.
* start the server.
* create an administrator user and an organization.
* ensure your workstation has all the files that it needs to communicate with Chef server.
* verify that you can connect to Chef server from your workstation.

[COMMENT] We use `sudo` to highlight where root access is required. You can omit `sudo` from the commands if you're running as the root user.
