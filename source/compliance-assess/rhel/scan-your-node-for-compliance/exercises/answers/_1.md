Your implementation will depend on your organization's requirements and goals. You might follow a common requirements standard, or you might have unique requirements that are specific to your company.

After you've identified a compliance issue, [repeat the steps](/compliance-remediate/rhel/remediate-the-compliance-failure-on-a-local-virtual-machine/) to remediate and verify  

You can also use community cookbooks on Chef Supermarket to perform many common tasks. The [Manage a basic web application](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/) tutorial shows you how. 



You can follow same steps as you did in this tutorial. Start by writing and applying your audit rules locally through Test Kitchen. After you get one or two tests to pass, you can begin to integrate things into your production pipeline. From there, you can connect your audits to Chef Analytics to notify the right people when your most important audits fail on your existing infrastructure.

The [audit-cis](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/audit-cis) cookbook provides a reference implementation for the Center for Internet Security [CIS Security Benchmarks](https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/downloads/compliance/). If you follow the CIS standard, apply the [CentOS 6](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/audit-cis/blob/master/recipes/centos6-110.rb) or [CentOS 7](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/audit-cis/blob/master/recipes/centos7-100.rb) benchmarks against your infrastructure. How closely to you adhere to the standard?
