If the Chef compliance scanner fails to create a connection, you'll see something like this:

![](compliance/connectivity_report_fail_centos7.png)

If you see this error, verify that:

* you can [manually connect over SSH](#step2) using your key pair.
* your node is [configured for non-interactive sessions](#step3).
* the Chef compliance scanner has the [SSH private key](#step4).

If the connectivity test still fails, log in to your Chef compliance scanner server and run this command. The output may help you find the source of the failure.

```bash
[vagrant@chef-compliance ~]$ sudo chef-compliance-ctl tail core
[...]
