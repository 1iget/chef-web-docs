<span style="font-size:16px;">1. Set up a recurring scan on your node. What might be the appropriate interval for the servers in your network?</span>

<span style="font-size:16px;">2. Add a second node. Scan both nodes on demand or schedule the scan for a later time.</span>

<span style="font-size:16px;">3. How might you remediate the failure to the **Ensure Firewall is active** rule? How might you ensure that the remediation <i>stays</i> good?</span>

<span style="font-size:16px;">4. Review the built-in compliance profiles. Which profiles map to your existing compliance requirements? What other requirements exist that you might want to add as a custom profile?</span>
