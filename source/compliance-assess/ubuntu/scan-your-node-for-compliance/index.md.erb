Chef Compliance comes with pre-configured _profiles_, or collections of compliance rules. You can also create your own profiles or extend the built-in ones.

You'll see the available profiles from the **Compliance** menu in the web interface.

A [compliance profile](https://docs.chef.io/compliance.html#compliance-profiles) defines the security criteria for a particular security framework or application. For example, the Apache profile defines security rules for Apache HTTP Server.

In this part, you'll scan your Ubuntu 14.04 node against the built-in [Center for Internet Secuirty (CIS) Benchmarks](https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org).

Here's what you'll do:

1. [Scan your node against the CIS Benchmarks](#step1)
1. [Review the scan results](#step2)
1. As an optional step, [clean up your environment](#howtocleanupyourenvironment)

[START_BOX]

## 1. Scan your node against the CIS Benchmarks

From the dashboard in the web interface, select your node and click **Scan**.

[COMMENT] You can scan multiple nodes at the same time.

Clear the checkbox for **Operating System Patch Level** and select **cis/cis-ubuntu14.04lts-level1**.

You can run Compliance scans on demand or schedule them to run at a later time. Click **Scan now** to begin the scan immediately.

Watch as your node is scanned. The scan may take a few minutes to complete.

## 2. Review the scan results

After the scan completes, you'll see a report that details the results.

The **Summary** section provides an overview for all nodes that were scanned. You'll see the number of tests that passed compliance and the number of issues that may require attention.

[TIP] You can always access a report from the **Reports** menu.

The **Scan Report** gives you additional details for each node that was scanned.

The result of each test appears in a table. Results are sorted by severity. As an example, locate **Ensure Firewall is active**.

You'll see that this test failed. You'll also see that the test receives a score of 10.0, meaning it is most critical.

In the next tutorial, you'll learn more about the **Ensure Firewall is active** rule and also how to use Chef to remediate the failure.

## How to clean up your environment

If you're interested in using Chef to remediate compliance failures, you can keep your Chef Compliance server and your node available. The next tutorial builds on this one.

If you're using cloud resources and need a break, you can temporarily suspend your instances and restart them later. If you're using a cloud provider such as AWS, keep in mind that your servers' public IP addresses are reassigned when you restart your instances. You'll need to update your node's IP address from the dashboard. To do so, click on your node and then update the IP address in the **Configuration** section.

If you want to remove your node or start the tutorial from the beginning, select your node from the dashboard and click **Remove**.

![](compliance/remove_node_ubuntu1404.png)

When you're finished, don't forget to tear down any cloud instances that you used to complete the tutorial.
