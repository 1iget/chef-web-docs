## 2. Set up your workstation, Chef server, a node to manage, and Chef Analytics

The second part of this tutorial uses your own Chef server, an Ubuntu 14.04 node to manage, and Chef Analytics server that are part of your infrastructure.

If you don't already have a Chef server and Chef Analytics set up, follow this Learn Chef tutorial before you continue.

After completing this tutorial, you'll have:

* the Chef development tools installed on your workstation.
* a Chef server running in your infrastructure.
* an Ubuntu 14.04 node to manage.
* a Chef Analytics server running in your infrastructure.

[COMMENT] In the _Get started with Chef Analytics_ tutorial, you'll have the option to choose which operating system to run on your node. We recommend that you use Ubuntu 14.04 so that you have a node that's already set up to use in this tutorial.
