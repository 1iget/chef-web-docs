[HEADLINE] Chef Analytics can help you produce consistently compliant infrastructure and react more quickly when your infrastructure falls out of compliance.

Changes to your infrastructure can be well-intentioned and behave like you expect, but can also violate your organization's compliance policy. In the previous lesson, you wrote a basic web server configuration, watched it fail your audit test, and then fixed and verfied the configuration so that it passes audit.

It's always best to identify and resolve compliance issues as soon as you identify them. Running your audit tests as you develop your infrastructure code is a great way to do that. However, it's not always possible in practice, for example, when:

* you have hundreds or even thousands of audit tests, and it's not practical to run them continually.
* you don't have access to the audit tests.
* you need to apply new and updated audit tests against existing infrastructure.

In this lesson, you'll see how to use _alerts_ to report and resolve an audit failure that occurs on your existing infrastructure.

[GITHUB] You can find the final code for this lesson [on GitHub](https://github.com/learn-chef/controls-for-compliance-ubuntu/releases/tag/lesson-2).
