You may have hundred of tests, this lets you focus on a few at a time...

Produce consistently compliant infrastructure, one that is not subject to configuration drift.

In this part, you'll set up a _notification_, or an action that occurs in response to an event, and a _rule_, or the conditions that define which events cause a notification to be sent.

A notification can be sent through email, HipChat, or to any HTTP endpoint. In this lesson, you'll set up an email notification. The rule will be to send the email notification when a `chef-client` run completes.

* Upload the basic_audit cookbook to your Chef server
* Bootstrap an Ubuntu node and apply the basic_audit cookbook
(alternatively, modify the run-list on your existing Ubuntu node)
Watch the event appear in the timeline
* Write the rule
* Run chef-client on the node
* Update the run-list to disable FTP access
* Run chef-client on the node
