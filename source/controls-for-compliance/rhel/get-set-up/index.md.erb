This tutorial comes in two parts. In the first part, you'll use Test Kitchen to apply cookbooks to virtual machines that run on your workstation. In the second part, you'll connect those cookbooks to your Chef server and to Chef Analytics.

You can complete both prerequisites now or do just the first before you work through the first part, and do the second before you work through the second part.
