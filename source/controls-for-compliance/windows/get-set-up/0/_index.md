## Before you begin

[WARN] Ensure that your workstation supports and is configured to use CPU virtualization. If you're using a virtual machine as your workstation through a program such as VMWare Fusion, ensure that nested virtualization is enabled on the virtual machine.

Also ensure that your workstation meets the [system requirements](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/End-user_documentation) requirements for running VirtualBox.

We also recommend that you have at least 50 GB of disk space available on your workstation. This will give you enough room to store your Windows Server base image and run two instances simultaneously.
