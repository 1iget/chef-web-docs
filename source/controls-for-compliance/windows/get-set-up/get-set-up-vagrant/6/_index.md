## 6. (Optional) Learn about Test Kitchen

The first part of this tutorial uses Test Kitchen to apply your audit and infrastructure code on a local virtual machine.

If you're not familiar with Test Kitchen, follow this Learn Chef tutorial to get set up with the tools and learn how Test Kitchen works.

We have one version of the tutorial that shows you how to work with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS virtual machine and another version that uses Ubuntu. Either will teach you what you need to know to use Test Kitchen in this tutorial. We'll have a version for Windows Server available soon.
