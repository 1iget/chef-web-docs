We recommend that you use a text editor that provides features such as syntax highlighting and line numbering to write Chef code.

If you're in a graphical environment, you can run `gedit &` to bring up the default text editor. We also like <%= link_to 'Atom', 'http://atom.io', target: '_blank' %> and <%= link_to 'Sublime Text', 'http://www.sublimetext.com', target: '_blank' %>.

If you prefer the command line, we recommend `vim`. This [interactive Vim tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html) tutorial can help you get oriented to the commands you'll need to create, edit, and save a file. `emacs` and `nano` are also popular text command-line based editors.
