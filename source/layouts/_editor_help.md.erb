[COMMENT] If you don't have a preferred text editor, try `vim`. This [interactive Vim tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html) tutorial can help you get oriented to the commands you'll need to create, edit, and save a file. The machines we supply have `vim`, `emacs`, and `nano`. If you are running in a graphical environment, you can try `gedit &`.
