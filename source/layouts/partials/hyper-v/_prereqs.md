Ensure that your workstation supports and is configured to use CPU virtualization. This setting is typically configured through your system's BIOS.

If you're using a virtual machine as your workstation through a program such as VMWare Fusion, ensure that nested virtualization is enabled on the virtual machine.

Also make sure that [your workstation can run Hyper-V](https://msdn.microsoft.com/virtualization/hyperv_on_windows/quick_start/walkthrough_compatibility).
