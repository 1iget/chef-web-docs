To install Windows Server on your virtual machine, you'll download the evaluation version of Windows Server as an ISO image and mount that image as a DVD drive. When your virtual machine boots, it will run the installer from the virtual DVD drive.

Download the ISO image of the evaluation version of Windows Server 2012 R2 to your workstation from this URL to the <code class="file-path">C:\iso</code> directory on your workstation. If you can't download the file to this location, you can choose another &ndash; just be sure to change <code class="file-path">C:\iso</code> to your path in the steps that follow.
