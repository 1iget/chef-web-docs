Now let's create a location on disk to store the base virtual machines and the virtual machines that Test Kitchen creates.

For this tutorial, we'll use <code class="file-path">C:\Hyper-V</code>. You can use a different location if you prefer, just be sure to replace <code class="file-path">C:\Hyper-V</code> with your path in the steps that follow.

Run this command to create the directory.

```ps
$ mkdir C:\Hyper-V
```
