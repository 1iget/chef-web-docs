Berkshelf requires a trusted SSL certificate in order to upload cookbooks. If you're using your own Chef server, and not hosted Chef, you'll need to configure Chef server [to use a trusted SSL certificate](https://osxdominion.wordpress.com/2015/02/25/configuring-chef-server-12-to-use-trusted-ssl-certs/). The [Chef documentation](http://docs.chef.io/server_security.html#ssl-protocols) describes how Chef server works with SSL certificates.<br/><br/>Alternatively, for testing purposes you can run `berks upload --no-ssl-verify` to disable SSL verification.
