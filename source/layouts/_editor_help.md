We recommend that you use a text editor that provides features such as syntax highlighting and line numbering to write Chef code.

On Windows, Mac OS, and graphical environments on Linux, [Atom](http://atom.io) and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) are popular for writing Chef code. On Linux, you can also run `gedit &` to bring up the default text editor.

If you're on Linux and prefer the command line, we recommend `vim`. This [interactive Vim tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html) tutorial can help you get oriented to the commands you'll need to create, edit, and save a file. `emacs` and `nano` are also popular text command-line based editors.
