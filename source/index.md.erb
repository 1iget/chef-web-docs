# Welcome to Learn Chef!

## Chef automates server configuration

[Chef](http://www.getchef.com) is the infrastructure automation and configuration management framework that you can think of simply as _infrastructure as code_.

With Chef, you administer your IT infrastructure from your workstation. Chef supports Mac OS X, Windows, and many flavors of Linux and UNIX.

## Chef is a language

With Chef, you use code to declare how you want your servers to be configured. Chef builds upon the Ruby programming language. Learning Chef is like learning the basics of a language. You can achieve 80% fluency very quickly, while the remaining 20% just takes practice. The best way to learn Chef is to _use_ Chef.

Even if you don't have experience with Ruby, we'll show you everything you need to know through hands-on examples.

## Learn Chef helps you understand the basics

Whether you're a developer or a systems administrator, take lunch at your desk and learn a new skill. We'll walk you through everthing you need to get started quickly.

To get started, all you need is a computer or virtual machine. If you don't have an environment to work with, we'll provide one for you.

You can try Chef on your Mac. You'll install the Chef tools locally and run through a few tutorials that teach you the basics.
