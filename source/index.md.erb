# Welcome to Learn Chef!

**Learn Chef** is here to help you understand the basics of [Chef](http://www.getchef.com), the infrastructure automation and configuration management framework that you can think of simply as _infrastructure as code_.

Whether you're a developer or a systems administrator, take lunch at your desk and learn a new skill. We'll walk you through everthing you need to get started quickly.

With Chef, you use code to declare how your servers should be configured. Chef builds upon the Ruby programming language. Even if you don't have experience with Ruby, we'll show you everything you need to know through hands-on examples. Learning Chef is like learning the basics of a language. You can achieve 80% fluency very quickly, while the remaining 20% just takes practice. The best way to learn Chef is to _use_ Chef.

With Chef, you administer your server infrastructure from your workstation. Chef supports Mac OS X, Windows, and many flavors of Linux and UNIX. To get started, all you need is your laptop or desktop computer. If you don't have an environment to work with, we'll provide one for you.

Just pick the typical server environment that you manage and we'll get started.
