# Welcome to Learn Chef!

[Chef](http://www.getchef.com) puts together resources that describe how to configure a system. 

Learn Chef is here to help you quickly learn the basics. Whether you're a developer or a systems administrator, we hope you'll spend a few lunch breaks with us as we walk you through hands-on examples.

With Chef, you administer your server infrastructure from your workstation. Chef supports Mac OS X, Windows, and many flavors of Linux and UNIX. To get started, all you need is your laptop or desktop computer. 

Pick your OS below and we'll get started.
