h1 Contact & Feedback
p We care about what you think!
p When we developed the Learn Chef campaign, we wanted to be as transparent as possible. If you get stuck, you should be able to ask for help. If you have a suggestion, you should be able to voice it. And if you find a bug, you should tell us about it. Whether you just <a href="/quickstart/converge">converged your first node</a> or want to suggest a <a href="/starter-use-cases">Starter Use Case</a>, we're hear to listen:
