h1 Contact & Feedback
p We care about what you think!
p Our philosophy is to be as open and transparent as possible. If you get stuck, you should be able to ask for help. If you have a suggestion, you should be able to voice it. And if you find a bug, you should tell us about it. 
p If you receive 401, 403, or other errors in your workflow, check out the <a href="http://docs.opscode.com/errors.html">Errors</a> page in the Chef documentation. If you don't find what you need, please <a href="http://www.opscode.com/support/tickets">file a help ticket</a>.
p We'd also love to hear your success stories, what we can do to improve the site, and what you'd like to see in future tutorials. We're here to listen.
