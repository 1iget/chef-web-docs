# Bootstrap your node

Recall that any computer that's managed by a Chef server is called a _node_. We call the process that installs the Chef tools on a node and the initial check-in to the Chef server _bootstrapping_ the node.

Let's bootstrap a node and execute the web server cookbook on it.

If you haven't set up a Chef server and uploaded your cookbook to it, the [previous lesson](/windows/get-ready-to-add-another-server/) shows you how.

## <i class="fa fa-windows" style="margin-right:3px;"></i> Get a Windows Server machine to bootstrap

In the previous tutorials, you configured the server directly. The machine you used had the Chef tools pre-installed. Now you need to get a machine that doesn't have the Chef tools on it so you can see how the bootstrap process works.

Like the previous tutorials, there are two ways to get set up.

Option 1: use your own machine. Any Windows Server machine that meets the [system requirements](<%= chef_docs_url %>/chef_system_requirements.html) works great. Don't install the Chef tools on it just yet.

Option 2: let us provide a Windows Server machine. Just click the button below.

## <i class="fa fa-tasks rediconcolor" style="margin-right:3px;"></i> Here's what you'll do

  1. [Install the knife windows plugin](#1installtheknifewindowsplugin)
  1. [Bootstrap your node](#2bootstrapyournode)
  1. [Confirm the result](#3confirmtheresult)

<hr>

## 1. Install the knife windows plugin

You need to install the <codeinline>knife windows</codeinline> plugin on your workstation so that you can configure remote Windows Server nodes. Run this command to install it.

```ps
$ chef gem install knife-windows
```

## 2. Bootstrap your node

<div class="indent" id="bootstrap-intro" data-chef-lab-template data-type="ec2-windows-fundamentals">
From your workstation, run this command to bootstrap your node. If you're working with your own server and not the one that we provide, replace <codeinline>{{address}}</codeinline> with your server's external address, <codeinline>{{user}}</codeinline> with your username, and <codeinline>{{password}}</codeinline> with your password.
</div>
<p/>
<div id="bootstrap-command" class="window">
            <nav class="control-window">
              <div class="close">x</div>
              <div class="minimize"></div>
              <div class="deactivate"></div>
            </nav>
            <h1 class="titleInside">Terminal: ~\chef-repo</h1>
            <div class="container" data-chef-lab-template data-type="ec2-windows-fundamentals"><div class="terminal"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">$</span></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code><span class="line command">knife bootstrap windows winrm {{address}} --winrm-user {{user}} --winrm-password {{password}} --node-name node1 --run-list learn\_chef\_iis</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
          </div>

[WINDOWS] This command uses the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) protocol to connect to Windows Server. You can also bootstrap [using the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol](<%= chef_docs_url %>/plugin_knife_windows.html#bootstrap-windows-ssh), which is typical for Linux-based systems.

The optional <codeinline>--node-name</codeinline> argument uniquely identifies the node with the Chef server. Its value can be whatever you want. The server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is the default.

## 3. Confirm the result

Two things just happened.

First, your node was associated with your hosted Enterprise Chef account. To verify this, navigate to the [Chef Management Console](<%= hec_manage_url %>/organizations). From the **Nodes** tab, you'll see an entry for the node you just bootstrapped.

You can also verify that the node successfully bootstrapped by running the <codeinline>knife node</codeinline> command.

```ps
# ~\chef-repo
$ knife node list
node1
```

Second, your node did an initial check in with the Chef server and ran the web server cookbook. To verify this, open a web browser from your workstation and navigate to your web server.

<hr>

# <i class="fa fa-question blueiconcolor" style="margin-right:3px;"></i> What did we see here?

The <codeinline>knife bootstrap</codeinline> command established a WinRM connection to the node, installed the Chef tools, downloaded the web server cookbook on the node, and ran it. In one command, Chef carried out most of the steps you previously dealt with manually.

Next let's spice things up and add some info about your web server to your home page.
