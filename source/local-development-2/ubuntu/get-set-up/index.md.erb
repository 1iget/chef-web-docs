Here you'll make sure that your workstation is set up for Chef development and also install the virtualization software.

[TIP] This page explains the manual steps to help you understand exactly what software you need to install and how to install it. Alternatively, you can also run the [ChefDK_Bootstrap](https://github.com/Nordstrom/chefdk_bootstrap) script to setup your Windows or Mac workstation for Chef development. The script installs [commonly used development tools](https://github.com/Nordstrom/chefdk_bootstrap#what-does-it-do) such as the Atom text editor, Git, VirtualBox, and Vagrant.

## Before you begin

Ensure that your workstation supports and is configured to use CPU virtualization. This setting is typically configured through your system's BIOS.

If you're using a virtual machine as your workstation through a program such as VMWare Fusion, [ensure that nested virtualization is enabled](https://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-8970) on the virtual machine.

Also ensure that your workstation meets the [system requirements](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/End-user_documentation) requirements for running VirtualBox.

## 1. Set up your workstation for Chef development

Although this tutorial doesn't involve the Chef server or managing a node, we recommend that you complete [Learn to manage an Ubuntu node](/manage-a-node/ubuntu/) before starting this tutorial.

If you wish to learn about local development before learning how to bootstrap a node, [perform these steps](/manage-a-node/ubuntu/get-set-up/) to set up your workstation. Then come back to this page.

At this point, your workstation should:

* have the latest version of the Chef Development Kit.
* have a programmer's text editor that you're comfortable working with.
* have the <code class="file-path">~/learn-chef</code> directory for you to work in.
* have an SSH client &ndash; we recommend installing Git if you're using a Windows workstation.

Having an SSH client is important because you'll log in to your Linux instance to verify your work.

## 2. Install VirtualBox

Install VirtualBox. VirtualBox manages your virtual machine instances.

## 3. Install Vagrant

Next, install Vagrant. Test Kitchen uses Vagrant to communicate with VirtualBox and to configure aspects of the virtual machine such as available memory, host name, and network settings.
