If you've gone through the tutorial previously, or you have enough familiarity with Chef and just want to see the Customers web application in action, here's how to bring things up quickly using Test Kitchen.

[START_BOX]

## Prerequisites

Your workstation must support and be configured to use CPU virtualization. This setting is typically configured through your system's BIOS. If you're using a virtual machine as your workstation through a program such as VMWare Fusion, ensure that nested virtualization is enabled on the virtual machine. With some modification, [you can use another Test Kitchen driver](https://docs.chef.io/kitchen.html#drivers) if your workstation does not support CPU virtualization.
  
On your workstation, you'll need:

* Chef DK
* VirtualBox
* Vagrant
* Git
* a directory to work in &ndash; we recommend <% fp '~/learn-chef' %>.

[Refer to these steps](/local-development-2/windows/get-set-up/) if you're missing any of these prerequisites.

## 1. Get the sources from GitHub

Clone the sources for the `awesome_customers_windows` cookbook from GitHub.

```bash
# ~
$ mkdir ~/learn-chef/cookbooks
$ cd ~/learn-chef/cookbooks
$ git clone https://github.com/learn-chef/awesome_customers_windows.git
Cloning into 'awesome_customers_windows'...
remote: Counting objects: 56, done.
remote: Total 56 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 56
Unpacking objects: 100% (56/56), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

## 2. Encrypt your database passwords 

Here, you'll create a secret key and use that key to encrypt passwords that allow access to MySQL. The tutorial [describes the process](/manage-a-web-app-2/windows/create-a-password-store/) in greater detail.

First, create these directories.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks
$ cd ~/learn-chef
$ mkdir .chef
$ mkdir data_bags
$ mkdir data_bags/database_passwords
```

Generate your secret key.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ openssl rand -base64 512 | tr -d '\r\n' > ~/learn-chef/.chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret
```

Write this to <% fp 'mysql_customers.json' %>

```ruby
# ~/learn-chef/data_bags/database_passwords/mysql_customers.json
{
  "id": "mysql_customers",
  "root_password": "mysql_root_password",
  "admin_password": "mysql_admin_password"
}
```

Encrypt the file.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ knife data bag from file database_passwords mysql_customers.json --secret-file .chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret --local-mode
Updated data_bag_item[database_passwords::mysql_customers]
```

## 3. Run Test Kitchen

From your cookbook's directory, <% fp '~/learn-chef/cookbooks/awesome_customers_windows' %>, run `kitchen converge`.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ cd ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/awesome_customers_windows
$ kitchen converge
-----> Starting Kitchen (v1.4.2)
-----> Creating <default-ubuntu-1404>...
       Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
       ==> default: Importing base box 'opscode-ubuntu-2012 R2'...
[...]
       Running handlers:
       Running handlers complete
       Chef Client finished, 131/213 resources updated in 07 minutes 03 seconds
       Finished converging <default-ubuntu-1404> (7m53.00s).
-----> Kitchen is finished. (8m40.54s)
```

## 4. Verify the result  

From a web browser on your workstation, navigate to your site at http://192.168.35.35.

## 5. Destroy your Test Kitchen instance  

When you're done experimenting, run `kitchen destroy` to clean things up.


```bash
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/awesome_customers_windows
$ kitchen destroy
-----> Starting Kitchen (v1.4.2)
-----> Destroying <default-ubuntu-1404>...
       Vagrant instance <default-ubuntu-1404> destroyed.
       Finished destroying <default-ubuntu-1404> (0m3.62s).
-----> Kitchen is finished. (0m4.43s)
```
