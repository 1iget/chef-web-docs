To complete this tutorial, you'll need three things &dash; the Chef Development Kit (Chef DK) installed on your workstation, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS node to manage, and a hosted Chef account.

This is a <% fp('/blah/html/blah.html') %>.

You'll also create a Chef code repository and a blank cookbook on your workstation to set up your web application project.

[COMMENT] If you want to clean up your workstation or your Chef server after you complete this tutorial or you want to repeat the tutorial from the beginning, [follow these steps](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/apply-and-verify-your-final-web-application-configuration#howtocleanupyourenvironment) at the end of this tutorial.

## 2. Get a node to manage

Recall that a _node_ is any physical machine, cloud instance, or virtual machine that Chef manages.

All you need to do right now is bring up a clean, 64-bit instance of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 or CentOS 6.5 that will serve as your node. Your node should not be your workstation. Be sure that:

* its IP address is accessible from your network.
* it has inbound network access on ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) and outbound network access on port 443 (HTTPS).
* it meets the [system requirements](https://docs.chef.io/chef_system_requirements.html#chef-client) for running `chef-client`.
* you have root or `sudo` access.

[WARN] Remember to use a 64-bit instance of Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS. This tutorial does not support 32-bit instances.

[WARN] Software such as Apache is configured differently in various releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS. For learning purposes, we recommend that you use Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 or CentOS 6.5 as your node so that you can more easily verify your progress. However, if you're unable to use Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 or CentOS 6.5, other versions can work with some modification.

[WARN] Some of the cookbooks and features that you'll use in this tutorial require `chef-client` version 12.4.0 or greater on your node. If you have an existing node that has a prior version of `chef-client`, [upgrade to the latest version](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-client/).

## 3. Get a hosted Chef account

You'll store your cookbooks on a Chef server so that your node can access them. Hosted Chef is the easiest way to work through this tutorial. We recommend you work through [Learn to manage a node](/manage-a-node/rhel/) if you do not have a hosted Chef account that you can access from your workstation.

[COMMENT] If your organization is [running its own Chef server](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-server/) and you know how to work with it, you can use that Chef server instead of setting up a hosted Chef account.
