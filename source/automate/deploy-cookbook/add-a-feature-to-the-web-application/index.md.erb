> Continue on the virtual Windows workstation that you used in the previous part.

At this point, you've validated that your pipeline works and you've configured it with your build cookbook. You're ready to use Chef Automate for what it was intended &ndash; moving changes quickly and safely all the way from your workstation to production.

In this part, you add a feature to the Customers web application by changing the `awesome_customers_delivery` cookbook. The feature adds additional sample data and also provides an interactive control that displays where your customers are on a globe. This feature uses [D3](http://d3js.org), a JavaScript library for producing interactive data visualizations.

This feature is provided for you in GitHub (your `origin` remote.) You first create a feature branch that's based off your local `master` branch. Then you integrate the completed feature branch from GitHub with your local feature branch.

You also use `delivery job` to verify your work and resolve test failures before you submit a change to the pipeline.

Here's what you'll do:

1. [Create the feature branch](#step1)
1. [Integrate the remote branch with your local feature branch](#step2)
1. [Run Chef Automate jobs to verify the change](#step3)
1. [Submit your change to the pipeline](#step4)

[START_BOX]

## 1. Create the feature branch

Start by creating a new feature branch named `visualize_data`.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery
$ git checkout -b visualize_data
Switched to a new branch 'visualize_data'
```

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 2. Integrate the remote branch with your local feature branch

Next, pull the remote branch from GitHub into your local `visualize_data` branch. This step integrates the feature branch with your build cookbook and the Chef Automate configuration file you set up in the previous part.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery
$ git pull https://github.com/learn-chef/awesome_customers_delivery visualize_data
From https://github.com/learn-chef/awesome_customers_delivery
 * branch            visualize_data -> FETCH_HEAD

 create mode 100644 files/default/world-110m.json
```

You see a few new files appear. These files support the new feature.

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 3. Run Chef Automate jobs to verify the change

Before you submit a change to the Chef Automate pipeline, you want to verify that the change works as expected and passes unit, lint, and syntax checks.

For a Chef cookbook, you might run [Test Kitchen](https://docs.chef.io/kitchen.html) as you build your feature to verify that it behaves as you expect on a temporary instance that resembles production. You might also run ChefSpec tests, Foodcritic, and RuboCop on your workstation. For an application or service, you might run a different set of tools to verify your work.

Another approach is to run [delivery job](https://docs.chef.io/ctl_delivery.html#delivery-job). Chef Automate uses `delivery job` to execute the phases on the build nodes as changes move through the pipeline. But you can also run `delivery job` to execute a phase directly on your workstation. Running jobs to exercise phases such as lint, unit, and syntax is a good way to be certain that your change is valid before it reaches the pipeline.

Start by running `delivery job verify unit --local` to run the unit phase under the Verify stage. The unit phase runs ChefSpec tests.

You can check out <% fp 'spec\unit\recipes\web_spec.rb' %> to see some of the ChefSpec tests that come with the `awesome_customers_delivery` cookbook.

You'll see no errors reported.

By default, `delivery job` configures the local system with build tools and other prerequisites that are needed for the project to run. This is an important step for build nodes. But because your virtual workstation is already configured with the Chef DK, you run `delivery job` with the `--local` flag to omit this step.

Now run `delivery job verify lint --local` to run lint testing. The lint phase runs Foodcritic and RuboCop.

```ps

You can see from the output that the syntax phase reports a failure!

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery
RuntimeError
------------
The awesome_customers_delivery cookbook was modified but the version was not updated in the metadata file.
```

The error tells us that we need to update the cookbook's version in <% fp 'metadata.rb' %>. When a cookbook changes, it's important to update its version to ensure that a given set of functionality is tied to a given version.

Let's fix the error and verify the change. According to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org), we should increment the MINOR version because we're adding backwards-compatible functionality.

Update the `version` field from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0 in your `awesome_customers_delivery` cookbook's <% fp 'metadata.rb' %> file.

```ruby-Win32
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery\metadata.rb
name 'awesome_customers_delivery'
maintainer 'The Authors'
maintainer_email 'you@example.com'
license 'all_rights'
description 'Installs/Configures awesome_customers_delivery'
long_description 'Installs/Configures awesome_customers_delivery'
version '0.2.0'

depends 'chef-sugar'
depends 'firewall', '~> 2.4.0'
depends 'httpd', '~> 0.3.4'
```

Commit the change to the local `visualize_data` branch.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery
$ git status
On branch visualize_data
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

$ git add metadata.rb
$ git commit -m "Bump cookbook version"

Run `delivery job verify syntax --local` to verify the fix.

The syntax test now passes! Running these checks helped us discover and fix a potential failure _before_ it reached the pipeline.

You are now ready to submit your change. In practice, you might run the lint and unit tests a second time to verify that your change to the cookbook's version does not break other functionality.

## 4. Submit your change to the pipeline

Before you submit your changes, run `git status` to verify that there are no pending changes.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery
$ git status
On branch visualize_data
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

Now run `delivery review` to submit your changes to the pipeline.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery
$ delivery review
Chef Automate
Loading configuration from C:\Users\Administrator\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery
Review for change visualize_data targeted for pipeline master
Created new patchset
https://10.0.0.12/e/delivery-demo/#/organizations/delivery-demo/projects/awesome_customers_delivery/changes/e2303bb7-1e3
c-4596-b2d5-5e0b76ca9688
```

When the Chef Automate UI appears, trace the change's progress through the pipeline.

1. Review the changes in the web interface. Click **Approve** when all tests pass. In practice, others would help review and approve your code changes.
1. Watch the change progress through the Build and Acceptance stages.
1. After the Acceptance stage completes, navigate to [http://10.0.0.15](http://10.0.0.15) from a second browser window. You'll see that the updated version of the Customers web application features the interactive control.

<img style="max-width:95%;" src="/assets/images/delivery/customers-visualize-data-delivered.png"/>

After you verify the change in Acceptance, press the **Deliver** button. You can watch the change progress through the Union, Rehearsal, and Delivered stages.

![](delivery/customers-visualize-data-delivered-pipeline.png)

Great work! By testing your changes locally, you can discover and fix potential problems before you submit your work. Once you do submit something, Chef Automate's central pipeline lets you and your team review both the code and build artifacts before you move any changes to production.

After your change gets merged into Chef Automate's `master` branch (this happens when you click the **Approve** button at the end of the Verify stage), you may want to integrate the change into your local `master` branch to prepare your copy of the source code for the next feature or bug fix. You'll checkout the `master` branch and run `git pull --prune` in the next part.
