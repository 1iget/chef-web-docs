## Stopping and restarting your AWS instances

In practice, it's common to keep your instances running so that users can access Chef Automate at any time. But because the setup process assigns a static, or fixed, private IP address to each instance, you can temporarily stop and restart your AWS instances as you evaluate Chef Automate.

To stop your instances:

1. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home).
1. Select **Running Instances**.
  ![](delivery/aws_running_instances.png)
1. Enter the name of your stack in the **Search** bar. An example is **chef-delivery-tutorial**.
1. Select all results. From the **Actions** menu, select **Instance State** > **Stop**.
  ![](delivery/aws_stop_instances.png)

To restart your instances, repeat steps 1&ndash;3 from the previous procedure. Select all results. From the **Actions** menu, select **Instance State** > **Start**.

After you restart your instances, you'll need to update your RDP connection to use the Windows workstation's [updated public IP address](#gettingthewindowsworkstationpublicipaddress).

## Getting the Windows workstation public IP address

If you stop your AWS instances, you'll need to get the Windows workstation's new public IP address when you restart your instances.

1. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home).
1. Select **Running Instances**.

1. In the **Search** bar, enter the Windows workstation's EC2 instance name, **delivery-tutorial-workstation**.
  ![](/assets/images/delivery/aws_search_10_0_0_5.png)
1. Your Windows workstation is returned as the result. Select the instance. In the details section, note the instance's public address. You can connect to the instance by either its public DNS name or its IP address.

## Deleting the Chef Automate project

If you ever need to start over, or you complete the tutorial and want to delete this project, you'll need to log in to the Chef Automate server (for example, over SSH) and run the `delivery-ctl delete-project` command.

For the tutorial, you can get the Chef Automate server's public IP address from the **Output** tab in CloudFormation or from the EC2 management console (search for the EC2 instance named **delivery-tutorial-delivery-server**.) The username is `ubuntu`. Here's an example of how to connect. You would do this from your own system, which has your AWS SSH key.

```bash
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/user.pem ubuntu@52.27.113.73
The authenticity of host '52.27.113.73 (52.27.113.73)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:BOLnibsx5Bdzg8zTl6c6l0p2tj8e6cgxmlA1hf6QAfQ.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '52.27.113.73' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
```

The `delivery-ctl delete-project` command takes your enterprise, organization, and project names as arguments, like this.

```bash
$ sudo delivery-ctl delete-project ENTERPRISE ORGANIZATION PROJECT
```

Here's how to delete the `awesome_customers_delivery` project in the tutorial environment:

```bash
$ sudo delivery-ctl delete-project delivery-demo delivery-demo awesome_customers_delivery
Successfully deleted project: 'delivery-demo/delivery-demo/awesome_customers_delivery'
```

## Tearing down your Chef Automate installation

Here's how to delete your stack when you're finished with your Chef Automate evaluation or if you want to start over. When you delete the stack, all resources that are part of the stack are torn down, including the instances and their network settings.

1. Navigate to the CloudFormation dashboard. [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home)
1. Select your stack, then right click and select **Delete Stack**.

1. Select **Yes, Delete** when prompted.
