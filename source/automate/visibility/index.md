Whether you're managing ten nodes or ten thousand, having real-time visibility into what's happening on the Chef server can help you stay on top of your Chef infrastructure. For example, say you want to know:

* when are users updating cookbooks?
* what changes were made immediately before my cookbook stopped working?
* when are new nodes added or existing ones removed?
* are my servers meeting our compliance requirements each time `chef-client` runs?

To answer these questions, you could periodically check the Chef management console or run `knife` to get the current state of your infrastructure. But pulling data doesn't give you a real-time view into your infrastructure. You could have nodes report back, for example, by writing a [handler](https://docs.chef.io/handlers.html), when events you care about occur. But that would require you to set up a reporting mechanism on each node, which is extra process to maintain and something that's likely not realistic as your infrastructure grows.

That's where Chef Automate's [visibility] capabilities come in. Chef Automate provides real-time visibility into what is happening on the Chef server, including whatâ€™s changing, who made those changes, and when they occurred.
