Congratulations. Your demo environment is now set up, giving you access to a fully-functional Chef Automate system.

Be sure to [review the appendix](/automate/install/managing-your-aws-instances) to learn how to manage your demo environment. If you need a break, you can [temporarily stop your AWS instances](/automate/install/managing-your-aws-instances#stoppingandrestartingyourawsinstances) and restart them later when you're ready. When you're completely finished with the evaluation or wish to start over, be sure to [tear down your installation](/automate/install/managing-your-aws-instances#tearingdownyourchefautomateinstallation).

In the next tutorial, [Gain visibility into your infrastructure with Chef Automate](/automate/visibility/), you'll bootstrap nodes provided by the demo environment to run a basic web application cookbook. You'll see how Chef Automate provides insight into what's happening on your Chef server, such as when `chef-client` completes. You'll also see how to use Chef Automate to detect when a `chef-client` run fails and remedy the failure.

After that, the [Deploy a cookbook with Chef Automate](/automate/deploy-cookbook/) tutorial walks you through delivering the web application cookbook using Chef Automate's workflow feature. You'll learn how to manage changes as they flow through the pipeline, beginning with a local workstation, through sets of automated tests, and out into production.
