The demo environment gives you access to a fully-functional Chef Automate system. Next, we recommend these Learn Chef tutorials, which walk you though some of Chef Automate's capabilities:

* A
* B

You can also [review the appendix](/automate/install/managing-your-aws-instances) to learn how to manage your demo environment.

When you're finished with the demo environment, [talk to us](http://lolw.ut) about how Chef Automate can help solve your infrastructure challenges.

### New to Chef?

Using Chef Automate to it's fullest requires some understanding of Chef's approach to infrastructure management. If you're new to Chef, you can still complete this tutorial successfully &ndash; we provide everything you need to get started.

After you complete the tutorial, you can use these resources to help further your understanding of many of the concepts involved.

[SKILL] In this tutorial, we use this callout to highlight additional resources that reinforce a Chef concept or skill.

#### Chef's test and repair approach

If you're new to Chef, we recommend that you first work through the [Learn the Chef basics](/learn-the-basics/rhel/) tutorial. You'll learn about Chef's test and repair approach by writing a Chef cookbook that brings up a basic web server configuration. We provide a free CentOS virtual machine that runs in your browser.

#### Working with a Chef server

If you don't have a Chef server, the [Manage a node](/manage-a-node/rhel/) tutorial gets you started. You'll learn how Chef server acts as a central repository for your cookbooks as well as for information about every node it manages. You'll sign up for hosted Chef and learn how to manage a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS server remotely from your workstation.

As an optional step, you can follow the [Install and manage your own Chef server](/install-and-manage-your-own-chef-server/linux/) tutorial to learn how to set up a Chef server that you manage.

#### Local development using Test Kitchen

If you're not familiar with local development using Test Kitchen, check out the [Develop your infrastructure code locally](/local-development/rhel/) tutorial. You'll learn how to use Test Kitchen along with the virtualization tools VirtualBox and Vagrant to develop and verify your infrastructure code _before_ you apply the configuration to your production servers.

As an optional exercise, the [Manage a basic web application](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/) tutorial provides additional hands-on practice with local development. Here, you configure a basic but complete web application using Test Kitchen. The [quickstart](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/bring-up-the-web-app-using-test-kitchen/) brings up the final configuration on a local test instance in minutes.
