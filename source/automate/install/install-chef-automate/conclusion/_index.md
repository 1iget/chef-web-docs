Congratulations. Your demo environment is now set up, giving you access to a fully-functional Chef Automate system.

Be sure to [review the appendix](/automate/install/managing-your-aws-instances) to learn how to manage your demo environment.

In the next tutorial, [Gain visibility into your infrastructure with Chef Automate](/automate/visibility/), you'll bootstrap nodes provided by the demo environment to run a basic web application cookbook. You'll see how Chef Automate provides insight into what's happening on your Chef server, such as when `chef-client` completes. You'll also see how to use Chef Automate to detect when a `chef-client` run fails and remedy the failure.

After that, the [Deploy a cookbook with Chef Automate](/automate/deploy-cookbook/) tutorial walks you through delivering the web application cookbook using Chef Automate's workflow features. You'll learn how to manage changes as they flow through the pipeline, beginning with a local workstation, through sets of automated tests, and out into production.

When you're finished with the demo environment, [talk to us](http://lolw.ut) about how Chef Automate can help solve your infrastructure challenges.

[PRODNOTE] Update "talk to us" link ^.

As you have questions or suggestions on how Chef Automate can better fit your workflow, join us on [Discourse](https://discourse.chef.io/c/delivery).

### New to Chef?

Using Chef Automate to it's fullest requires some understanding of Chef's approach to infrastructure management. If you're new to Chef, you can still complete this tutorial successfully &ndash; we provide everything you need to get started.

After you complete the tutorial, [review these additional resources](http://lolw.ut) to help build your Chef skills.

[PRODNOTE] Colin wanted to have something that speaks to this. Is it still on tap?
