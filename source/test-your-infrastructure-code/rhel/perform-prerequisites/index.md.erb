This tutorial builds on the _Develop your infrastructure code locally_ tutorial, and has the same prerequisites.

If you're not familiar with local development using Test Kitchen, check out [Develop your infrastructure code locally](/local-development/rhel/) before you start this tutorial. You'll learn how to use Test Kitchen along with the virtualization tools VirtualBox and Vagrant to develop and verify your infrastructure code _before_ you apply the configuration to your production servers.

As an optional exercise, the [Manage a basic web application](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/) tutorial provides additional hands-on practice with local development. Here, you configure a basic but complete web application using Test Kitchen. The [quickstart](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/bring-up-the-web-app-using-test-kitchen/) brings up the final configuration on a local test instance in just a few minutes. This tutorial prepares you for the [appendix](/test-your-infrastructure-code/rhel/refactor-the-web-application-cookbook/) which walks you through a basic refactoring exercise.
