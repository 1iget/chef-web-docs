In this part, you'll learn basics of the local development process using Test Kitchen if you haven't already. You'll also install the `kitchen-inspec` gem, which is a library that enables InSpec tests to run from Test Kitchen.

## 1. Get set up for local development

This tutorial builds on the _Develop your infrastructure code locally_ tutorial, and has the same prerequisites. 

If you're not familiar with local development using Test Kitchen, check out [Develop your infrastructure code locally](/local-development/rhel/) before you start this tutorial. You'll learn how to use Test Kitchen along with the virtualization tools VirtualBox and Vagrant to develop and verify your infrastructure code _before_ you apply the configuration to your production servers.

As an optional exercise, the [Manage a basic web application](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/) tutorial provides additional hands-on practice with local development. Here, you configure a basic but complete web application using Test Kitchen. The [quickstart](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/bring-up-the-web-app-using-test-kitchen/) brings up the final configuration on a local test instance in just a few minutes. We recommend this tutorial if you're interested in [learning how to refactor your Chef code TODO](/) to be more readable.

## 2. Install kitchen-inspec

In this tutorial, you'll write InSpec code to verify your configuration. To run InSpec tests from Test Kitchen, you need the `kitchen-inspec` gem. Install `kitchen-inspec` like this.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ chef gem install kitchen-inspec
Fetching: kitchen-inspec-0.12.5.gem (100%)
Successfully installed kitchen-inspec-0.12.5
