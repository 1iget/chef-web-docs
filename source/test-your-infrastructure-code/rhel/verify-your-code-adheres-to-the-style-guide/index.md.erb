[HEADLINE] Lint testing can help you identify potential defects in your code early and also makes  your code easier to read and maintain.

So far, you've learned how to use automated testing to speed up the feedback cycle. Getting feedback early and often can help you release more quickly and with higher quality.

Although your code may behave as you expect, it's also important to ensure your code is easy to read and maintain, and avoids defects that can be difficult to fix later. Lint testing, or _linting_, is one way to help ensure that your code aheres to standard style guidelines and avoids common defects.

Lint testing is a form of [static program analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis), also called _static code analytis_. Static code analysis involves the automated inspection of a program's source code for potential defects without actually running the program.

Lint testing can identify a range of issues, from code that's correct but difficult to read (such as code that uses non-uniform indentation) all the way to code that surely has an error (such as using an invalid character in a variable name.)

In this lesson, you'll use two popular tools that are part of the Chef DK &ndash; [RuboCop](http://batsov.com/rubocop/) and [Foodcritic](https://acrmp.github.io/foodcritic/) &ndash; to identify potential issues in variations of the `webserver` cookbook you created previously. You'll also learn how to disable certain rules and also create new rules that define your team's preferred style.
