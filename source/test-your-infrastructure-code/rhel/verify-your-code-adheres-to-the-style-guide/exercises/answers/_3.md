You might use the test-driven approach by initially watching the tests fail and then adding just enough code to make the failing tests pass.

To start, create a cookbook named `email`.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ chef generate cookbook cookbooks/email
Installing Cookbook Gems:
Compiling Cookbooks...
Recipe: code_generator::cookbook
  * directory[/Users/user/learn-chef/cookbooks/email] action create
    - create new directory /Users/user/learn-chef/cookbooks/email
[...]
  * cookbook_file[/Users/user/learn-chef/cookbooks/email/.gitignore] action create
    - create new file /Users/user/learn-chef/cookbooks/email/.gitignore
    - update content in file /Users/user/learn-chef/cookbooks/email/.gitignore from none to dd37b2
    (diff output suppressed by config)
```

Recall that Chef creates a directory structure to store Serverspec tests. Rename this directory so that we can write InSpec tests.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ mv cookbooks/email/test/integration/default/serverspec cookbooks/email/test/integration/default/inspec
```

Add the InSpec tests to <code class="file-path">default_spec.rb</code>.

```ruby
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/email/test/integration/default/serverspec/default_spec.rb
describe package 'postfix' do
  it { should be_installed }
end

describe service 'postfix' do
  it { should be_enabled }
  it { should be_running }
end

describe file '/etc/postfix/main.cf' do
  its('content') { should match /^mydomain = example.com$/ }
  its('content') { should match /^myorigin = example.com$/ }
end
```

Set up your <code class="file-path">.kitchen.yml</code> file like this.

```yaml
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/email/.kitchen.yml
---
driver:
  name: vagrant

provisioner:
  name: chef_zero

verifier:
  name: inspec

platforms:
  - name: centos-7.2
    driver:
      customize:
        memory: 256

suites:
  - name: default
    run_list:
      - recipe[email::default]
    attributes:
```

Run the test through Test Kitchen.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/email
$ kitchen verify
-----> Starting Kitchen (v1.8.0)
-----> Creating <default-centos-72>...

```

You'll see that the first 3 tests pass, which tells you that Postfix is installed and running. However, the failures indicate that Postfix is not configured to use the example.com domain in outbound mail.

Let's use the [postfix cookbook](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/postfix) from Chef Supermarket to configure Postfix how we want it.

Start by adding a dependency on the `postfix` cookbook from your cookbook's <code class="file-path">metadata.rb</code> file.

```ruby
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/email/metadata.rb
name 'email'
maintainer 'The Authors'
maintainer_email 'you@example.com'
license 'all_rights'
description 'Installs/Configures email'
long_description 'Installs/Configures email'
version '0.1.0'

depends 'postfix', '~> 3.8.0'
```

Now call the `postfix` cookbook's default recipe from your cookbook's default recipe.

```ruby
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/email/recipes/default.rb
include_recipe 'postfix::default'
```

You'll see from the postfix cookbook's documentation that these node attributes control the settings for `mydomain` and `myorigin` in the <code class="file-path">/etc/postfix/main.cf</code> configuration file.

* `node['postfix']['main']['mydomain']`
* `node['postfix']['main']['myorigin']`

An easy way to set these node attributes is from your <code class="file-path">.kitchen.yml</code> file. Modify your copy like this.

```yaml
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/email/.kitchen.yml
---
driver:
  name: vagrant

provisioner:
  name: chef_zero

verifier:
  name: inspec

platforms:
  - name: centos-7.2
    driver:
      customize:
        memory: 256

suites:
  - name: default
    run_list:
      - recipe[email::default]
    attributes:
      postfix:
        main:
          mydomain: 'example.com'
          myorigin: 'example.com'
```

Run `kitchen converge` to apply the configuration and then `kitchen verify` to run the tests.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/email
$ kitchen converge

This time all tests pass! Although a more complete implementation might require additional tests to ensure that the server can send mail, once all tests pass, you know that your task is complete.

As an optional step, you might run your cookbook through RuboCop or Foodcritic. What results do you see?
