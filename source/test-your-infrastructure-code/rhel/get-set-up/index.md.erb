The first part of this tutorial uses Test Kitchen to apply and test a basic web server configuration on a local virtual machine.

The last part builds on the `awesome_customers` cookbook that you created in the previous two tutorials &ndash; [Manage a basic web application](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/) and [Develop your infrastructure code locally](/local-development/rhel/).

Here, you'll get set up with Test Kitchen and get the `awesome_customers` cookbook if you haven't completed the previous tutorials.
