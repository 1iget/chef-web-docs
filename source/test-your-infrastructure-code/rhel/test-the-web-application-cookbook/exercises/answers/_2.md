Lint testing can help improve the quality of your code in two ways.

1. It helps ensure that your code is easy to read and maintain, and conforms to accepted guidelines.
1. It helps ensure that your code avoids common defects.

RuboCop bases its rules on the community Ruby style guide, and can identify many areas where your code can be revised for improved readability, but can also spot many common defects.

Foodcritic was written with Chef specifically in mind. It is able to identify common defects, including potential misuse of specific resource types and invalid resource actions.

Because each tool identifies a different set of usage patterns and are both fast to run, many Chef users perform both RuboCop and Foodcritic tests as part of their testing workflow.
