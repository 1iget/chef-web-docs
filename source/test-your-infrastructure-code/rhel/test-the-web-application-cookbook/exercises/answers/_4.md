Add the code to your `webserver` cookbook's default recipe and run RuboCop like this.

```bash
# ~/webserver/recipes
$ rubocop .
Inspecting 1 file
W

Offenses:

default.rb:7:1: C: Indent when as deep as case.
when 'centos' then 'httpd'
^^^^
default.rb:8:1: C: Indent when as deep as case.
when 'ubuntu' then 'apache2'
^^^^
default.rb:9:1: W: end at 9, 0 is not aligned with case at 6, 30.
end
^^^

1 file inspected, 3 offenses detected
```

In this situation, you likely wouldn't want to indent the `when` statements as deep as the `case` statement, so one way to fix this is to simply move the `case` statement to the next line.

```ruby
# ~/webserver/recipes/default.rb
package_name = service_name =
case node['platform']
when 'centos' then 'httpd'
when 'ubuntu' then 'apache2'
end
```

Run RuboCop a second time to verify that the violation is resolved.

```bash
# ~/webserver/recipes
$ rubocop .
Inspecting 1 file
.

1 file inspected, no offenses detected
```

If your team's style guide prefers the variable assignments to stay on the same line as the `case` statement, you might disable the indentation of `when` rule in your <code class="file-path">.rubocop.yml</code> file (you can find this rule in RuboCop's [default rules](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/blob/master/config/default.yml).)

```ruby
# rubocop.yml
# Indentation of `when`.
Style/CaseIndentation:
  Enabled: false
```

However, you would still need to deal with the `end` block not being aligned with its `case`.

```bash
# ~/webserver/recipes
$ rubocop .
Inspecting 1 file
W

Offenses:

recipes/default.rb:9:1: W: end at 9, 0 is not aligned with case at 6, 30.
end
^^^

1 file inspected, 1 offense detected
```

To fix that, you can add a comment directly to your recipe that disables the `EndAlignment` rule.

```ruby
# ~/webserver/recipes/default.rb
package_name = service_name = case node['platform']
when 'centos' then 'httpd'
when 'ubuntu' then 'apache2'
end # rubocop:disable Lint/EndAlignment
```

```bash
# ~/webserver/recipes
$ rubocop .
Inspecting 1 file
.

1 file inspected, no offenses detected
```
