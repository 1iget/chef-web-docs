In this tutorial you installed Chef Delivery, validated it, created a build cookbook, and updated the `awesome_customers` cookbook to add two features to the Customers web application. Finally, you tested the cookbook locally and then submitted it to Chef Delivery where it moved through the pipeline all the way to its final destination, a Chef server.

Along the way, you learned about a Delivery pipeline's stages and phases. You configured them to run automated tests and to publish to specific targets. As bonuses, you got to try out Chef provisioning and practice your Git skills.
