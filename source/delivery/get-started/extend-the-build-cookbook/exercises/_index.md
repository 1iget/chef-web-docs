## Next steps

[PRODNOTE] We should decide on what steps we really want the user to take next. For example, dumping in Analytics or Compliance may be too much without guidance. We should also talk about how we want the user to get in touch with us to disucss further.

Here's your chance to make Chef Delivery your own. Here are some ideas to get started.

* Add a new feature to the Customers web application and watch it move down the pipeline. Even a small change to the CSS or the addition of a new unit test is enough to practice the workflow.
* Chef Delivery is all about collaboration. Invite others to your organization. Submit a change and apply your established review process to approve and deliver new features.
* If you've gone through the [Get Started with Chef Analytics](/tutorials/#get-started-with-chef-analytics) and [Audit a node for compliance](/tutorials/#controls-for-compliance) tutorials, take what you've learned and make your Delivery pipeline even more powerful.  Write some automated audit tests, and install the Chef Analytics server to see what's happening and to generate alerts.
* If you use Chef Supermarket, integrate Chef Delivery with your Supermarket server. The `delivery-truck` cookbook makes it easy to publish your cookbooks not only to Chef server, but to Supermarket as well.
* Clone an existing project &ndash; this can be a cookbook, application, or service &ndash; into Chef Delivery's integrated Git server. Write a build cookbook that's tailored to how you test and verify new features, build and publish your artifacts, and deploy to your infrastructure environments.
