[CALLOUT networks/team-members-workstation.svg] Continue on the Windows workstation that you set up in the previous part.

Chef Delivery uses _projects_ to organize work across multiple teams. You can create as many projects as you need. A common approach is to have one project for each major component of your system.

Each project has its own Git repository. Chef Delivery can host the Git repository for you or you can connect Delivery to an existing Git project, such as one on GitHub. In this tutorial, you get starter code from GitHub but host your project in Delivery's Git repository.

In this part, you create a project and watch the `awesome_customers_delivery` cookbook move through each stage of the Delivery pipeline. You perform these tasks:

1. [Clone the awesome\_customers_delivery repo from GitHub](#step1)
1. [Create the project and the pipeline](#step2)
1. [Watch the Verify stage run](#step3)
1. [Configure the build cookbook to publish to Chef server](#step4)
1. [Submit the change](#step5)
1. [Approve the change](#step6)
1. [Deliver the change](#step7)
1. [Integrate the change to your local master branch](#step8)
1. Learn [how to delete your project](#howtodeleteyourproject) if you need to later

During the process, you'll see how the `delivery-truck` cookbook can perform many common tasks that are needed to deliver Chef cookbooks.

Recall that you can use Chef Delivery to deploy almost any kind of software or infrastructure project and that a [build cookbook](https://docs.chef.io/release/delivery/build_cookbooks.html) defines how changes are verified, built, and deployed.

[delivery-truck](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/delivery-truck) is a build cookbook that's designed specifically for Chef cookbook projects. `delivery-truck` handles many common tasks, including:

* Running common cookbook test suites like [ChefSpec](https://docs.chef.io/chefspec.html), [Foodcritic](https://docs.chef.io/foodcritic.html), and [RuboCop](https://docs.chef.io/rubocop.html).
* Publishing your cookbook to Chef server, Chef Supermarket, GitHub, or another Git server.
* Triggering `chef-client` to run on nodes that use your cookbook. 

[COMMENT] If your administrator installed Chef Delivery, be sure to [set up your workstation](/delivery/get-started/set-up-your-workstation/) before starting this part.

[START_BOX]

## 1. Clone the awesome\_customers_delivery repo from GitHub

In this step, you clone the repository from GitHub to your local repository directory. This repository contains the `awesome_customers_delivery` cookbook, which configures the Customers web application.

From a PowerShell prompt, move to your working directory, <% fp '~\delivery-demo' %>.

```ps
#
$ cd ~\delivery-demo
```

Clone the `awesome_customers_delivery` repo from GitHub.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo
$ git clone https://github.com/learn-chef/awesome_customers_delivery.git
Cloning into 'awesome_customers_delivery'...
remote: Counting objects: 212, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (27/27), done.
Receiving objects: 100% (212/212), 65.35 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.9

Resolving deltas: 100% (49/49), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

Move to the <% fp 'awesome_customers_delivery' %> directory.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo
$ cd awesome_customers_delivery
```

Remember, for the tutorial, you're cloning an existing Git project to obtain starter code. You can configure Chef Delivery to connect directly with your existing Git projects, import code from another source control system, or create a new repository.

[COMMENT] The workstaton comes with [posh-git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git), which integrates Git with PowerShell. post-git provides useful features such as tab completion and the ability to show the current branch and the state of files.

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 2. Create the project and the pipeline

There are a few ways to [create a Delivery project](https://docs.chef.io/delivery_cookbooks.html#set-up-projects). Here, you use the `delivery init` command. This command:

* creates a project in Chef Delivery, which includes a new Git repository that's hosted on the Delivery server.
* creates a default pipeline whose target branch is `master`.
* initializes the `master` branch in Delivery's Git repo from the existing `master` branch that you just cloned (`delivery init` detects whether there is an existing Git repository).
* creates a branch named `add-delivery-config`, which is based off of `master`.
* creates the <% fp '.delivery' %> directory and adds to it a build cookbook and a configuration file.
* submits the change for review.

Run `delivery init` from your local repository directory. When prompted, enter the password that's associated with your Chef Delivery account.

If you're prompted to choose the default web browser, choose Google Chrome.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery

```

The `delivery` command uses your password to generate an API token that's used to make authorized requests to your Chef Delivery server. The `delivery` command writes this API token to <% fp '~/.delivery/api-tokens' %>.

A browser window appears and the first stage of the pipeline, Verify, begins running its phases.

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 3. Watch the Verify stage run

When you run `delivery init`, two things happen. The first stage of the pipeline, Verify, begins and the Delivery web interface appears. With it, you can trace the progress of the cookbook as it moves through each stage and its associated phases.

![](delivery/delivery-init-running.png)

While the Verify stage runs, let's take a closer look at your project.

The `delivery init` command creates the <% '.delivery' %> directory at the root of your project. This directory contains two important pieces &ndash; a configuration file (<% fp 'config.json' %>) and the build cookbook (under the <% fp 'build-cookbook' %> directory).

```ps

                            default.rb
```

Your build cookbook consists of recipes. Each recipe corresponds to a phase, such as lint or syntax. Any time that a phase runs, no matter in which stage, it uses the same recipe. For example, the recipe for the lint phase runs in the Verify and Build stages. You can use conditional logic to customize how the recipe behaves for a given stage.

<img src="/assets/images/delivery/delivery_full_workflow.svg" style="width: 100%; box-shadow: none;" alt="Chef Delivery's pull pipeline" />

Each phase runs on a build node. If you have multiple build nodes, phases can run in parallel, for example, unit and syntax. The automated installation process for this tutorial creates two build nodes.

The build node that's running Verify, for example, merges your changes into `master` on a temporary copy of the main repository and runs the tests against `master`.

How you define each phase depends on your project and its requirements. For example, if your project is a web application that contains JavaScript, you might run JSLint as part of the lint phase. Alternatively, if you don't currently run lint tests on your code, you can leave the phase empty or configure Chef Delivery to skip it.

Our project is a Chef cookbook. Here's a brief summary of what each phase accomplishes.

* lint &ndash; run [Foodcritic](https://docs.chef.io/foodcritic.html) and [RuboCop](https://docs.chef.io/rubocop.html).
* syntax &ndash; run [knife cookbook test](https://docs.chef.io/knife_cookbook.html#test).
* unit &ndash; run [ChefSpec](https://docs.chef.io/chefspec.html).
* publish &ndash; upload `awesome_customers_delivery` and the cookbooks it depends on to the Chef server.
* deploy &ndash; run `chef-client` on the node that runs the web application.
* smoke &ndash; verify that the web server is at least minimally functional.

For this project, no specific action is required for the security, quality, provision, and functional phases.

[TIP] [Learn more about Foodcritic, RuboCop, and other Chef testing tools](/skills/test-driven-development/).

To help implement these steps, we use the `delivery-truck` cookbook. This cookbook performs tasks that are typical for a cookbook project. For example, its unit recipe runs ChefSpec and its lint recipe runs Foodcritic and RuboCop. The `delivery-truck` cookbook is already included for you as a dependency of your build cookbook.

Here's how `delivery-truck` is referenced in your build cookbook's metadata file.

```ruby
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery\.delivery\build-cookbook\metadata.rb
name 'build-cookbook'
maintainer 'The Authors'
maintainer_email 'you@example.com'
license 'all_rights'
version '0.1.0'

depends 'delivery-truck'
```

Each of your build cookbook's 11 recipes includes the implementation provided by `delivery-truck`. Here's an example for the `lint` recipe.

```ruby
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery\.delivery\build-cookbook\recipes\lint.rb
#
# Cookbook Name:: build-cookbook
# Recipe:: lint
#
# Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors, All Rights Reserved.
include_recipe 'delivery-truck::lint'
```

Here's how [delivery-truck implements the lint phase](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/delivery-truck/blob/master/recipes/lint.rb).

```ruby
# lint.rb
changed_cookbooks.each do |cookbook|
  # Run Foodcritic against any cookbooks that were modified.
  execute "lint_foodcritic_#{cookbook.name}" do
    command "foodcritic -f correctness #{foodcritic_tags} #{foodcritic_excludes} #{cookbook.path}"
  end

  # Run Rubocop against any cookbooks that were modified.
  execute "lint_rubocop_#{cookbook.name}" do
    command "rubocop #{cookbook.path}"
    environment(
      # workaround for https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/issues/2407
      'USER' => (ENV['USER'] || 'dbuild')
    )
    only_if { File.exist?(File.join(cookbook.path, '.rubocop.yml')) }
  end
end
```

You can modify a recipe in your build cookbook to fit your requirements. For example, you might add additional code or remove the `include_recipe` line entirely to specify your own implementation.

Now go back to the Delivery web interface. When the Verify stage completes, you'll see that all 3 tests pass.

![](delivery/delivery-init-result.png)

A manual step is required to move to the Build stage. This is where your team decides whether the code can be merged into the `master` branch or more work is needed.

We're not quite ready yet to to merge the change to `master`. First, we need to configure the build cookbook to publish the `awesome_customers_delivery` cookbook to the Chef server.

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 4. Configure the build cookbook to publish to Chef server

In this step, you configure your build cookbook to publish the `awesome_customers_delivery` cookbook to the Chef server during the publish phase. Then you commit that change to the `add-delivery-config` branch and submit the change for review.

Recall that the `delivery init` command creates a file named <% fp '.delivery\config.json' %> in your project directory. This configuration file controls the behavior of your build cookbook. Here's what the file looks like.

```ruby
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery\.delivery\config.json
{
  "version": "2",
  "build_cookbook": {
    "name": "build-cookbook",
    "path": ".delivery/build-cookbook"
  },
  "skip_phases": [],
  "build_nodes": {},
  "dependencies": []
}
```

These configuration settings become node attributes on your build nodes. You can also use this file to [control how delivery-truck behaves](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/delivery-truck#customizing-behavior-using-deliveryconfigjson).

To specify that the cookbook should be published to Chef server, modify your copy of <% fp '.delivery\config.json' %> like this.

```ruby
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery\.delivery\config.json
{
  "version": "2",
  "build_cookbook": {
    "name": "build-cookbook",
    "path": ".delivery/build-cookbook"
  },
  "skip_phases": [],
  "build_nodes": {},
  "dependencies": [],
  "delivery-truck": {
    "publish": {
      "chef_server": true
    }
  }
}
```

Run `git status`. You'll see that `add-delivery-config` is the current branch and that <% fp '.delivery\config.json' %> is not yet staged for commit.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery
$ git status
On branch add-delivery-config
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   .delivery/config.json

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Now run `git add` to stage <% fp '.delivery\config.json' %> for commit.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery
$ git add .\.delivery\config.json
warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in .delivery/config.json.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.
```

Now run `git commit` to commit the change.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery
$ git commit -m "Publish to Chef server"
[add-delivery-config warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in .delivery/config.json.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.

The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.
 1 file changed, 7 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 5. Submit the change

Run `delivery review` to submit your change to the `add-delivery-config` branch for review as a new patchset.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery
$ delivery review
Chef Delivery
Loading configuration from C:\Users\chef\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery

```

[COMMENT] If you use GitHub, you know that pull requests let you tell others about your changes. The [delivery review](https://docs.chef.io/ctl_delivery.html#delivery-review) command is similar. It allows others to review your changes. Once approved, Delivery merges your changes into `master` and continues through the rest of the pipeline.

A browser window opens to show the pipeline in Chef Delivery. The Verify stage is automatically triggered and runs the unit, lint and syntax phases.

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 6. Approve the change

The next step is to approve the change. This is a manual step, where people on your team have a chance to review the code and promote it to the Build stage.

Let's review and approve the changes. In practice, others on your team would assist with the review.

From the **Review** tab, click on a few files to see how they changed. Here's an example for the change you made to <% fp '.delivery\config.json' %>

![](delivery/review_config.png)

The files are new, so each change appears as an add <img style="box-shadow:none; margin:0; display:inline;" src="/assets/images/delivery/review_add_icon.png"/> operation. For an existing file that's been modified <img style="box-shadow:none; margin:0; display:inline;" src="/assets/images/delivery/review_modify_icon.png"/>, you would see the diff between the current version and the proposed change.

Scroll down to the bottom of Patchset 2 and enter a comment.

![](delivery/delivery-init-add-comment.png)

Click the **Add Comment** button.

Scroll back to the top of the patchset and click **Approve**.

![](delivery/delivery-init-approve.png)

Then click **Confirm**.

![](delivery/delivery-init-approve-modal.png)

The **Approve** action merges the `add-delivery-config` branch into the `master` branch and deletes the `add-delivery-config` branch from the server.

[COMMENT] You need to first wait for the unit, lint, and syntax phases to complete before you can approve a patchset. This ensures that all tests pass before the change is merged into the target branch.

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 7. Deliver the change

After you approve the change, the change moves to the Build stage.

<img src="/assets/images/delivery/delivery_full_workflow_build.svg" style="width: 100%; box-shadow: none;" alt="Chef Delivery's pull pipeline" />

The unit, lint, and syntax phases run again on the build node. Rerunning the tests ensures that they continue to pass after the change is merged to `master`.

The Build stage also runs the security and quality phases. By default, these phases do nothing. Then the publish phase runs. This phase creates an artifact (in our case, a cookbook) that is a release candidate. Recall that you configured `delivery-truck` to publish the `awesome_customers_delivery` cookbook to Chef server. `delivery-truck` runs the `knife cookbook upload` command to do that ([source code](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/delivery-truck/blob/master/recipes/publish.rb)).

![](delivery/delivery-init-build.png)

After the Build stage completes, the process moves to the Acceptance stage.

<img src="/assets/images/delivery/delivery_full_workflow_acceptance.svg" style="width: 100%; box-shadow: none;" alt="Chef Delivery's pull pipeline" />

Beginning with the Acceptance stage, the pipeline switches from analyzing the project's source code to verifying the artifacts produced in the Build stage. The goal of the Acceptance stage is for the team to make a decision about whether the change should go all the way out to production or not.

The Acceptance stage runs the provision, deploy, smoke, and functional phases.

The provision phase is where you can bring up infrastructure to run your artifact. The automated Delivery installation provides an Ubuntu server to run the cookbook in the Acceptance stage. This server is already bootstrapped to the Chef server, so no specific action is required.

The deploy phase deploys the artifact created in the Build stage. The `delivery-truck` cookbook submits a [push job](https://docs.chef.io/push_jobs.html) that runs `chef-client` to deploy the `awesome_customers_delivery` cookbook to the infrastructure that's associated with the Acceptance stage.

Delivery uses [search](https://docs.chef.io/chef_search.html) to find the node that matches the Acceptance [environment](https://docs.chef.io/environments.html) and has the `awesome_customers_delivery` cookbook in its run-list ([source code](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/delivery-truck/blob/master/recipes/deploy.rb)). The automated Delivery installation sets up the environment and the run-list for you.

After the Acceptance stage completes, navigate to [http://10.0.0.15](http://10.0.0.15) from a second browser window. You'll see the Customers web application.

<img style="max-width:100%;" src="/assets/images/delivery/acceptance-customers-verify.png"/>

After confirming that the web application comes up as expected, navigate back to the Delivery web interface and press the **Deliver** button. Pressing the **Deliver** button is a confirmation that the artifact can be released. The artifact will move through the next three pipeline stages automatically.

![](delivery/delivery-init-deliver.png)

Press the **Confirm** button from the dialog that appears.

![](delivery/delivery-init-confirm-delivery.png)

You'll see the process move through the Union, Rehearsal, and Delivered stages.

<img style="max-width:90%;" src="/assets/images/delivery/delivery-init-delivered.png"/>

The automation you ran to install Chef Delivery provides infrastructure only for the Acceptance stage. If you had infrastructure for the Union, Rehearsal, and Delivered stages, the Customers web application would deploy to each of those environments as the change moves through the pipeline.

The Union, Rehearsal, and Delivered stages form a shared pipeline, where all the projects that make up the entire system come together. All three stages have the same phases.

The Union stage assesses the impact of the change in the context of a complete (or as close as possible) installation of the set of projects that comprise the entire system. Union is where you test for interactions between interdependent projects.

If all phases of Union succeed, then the Rehearsal stage is triggered. Rehearsal increases confidence in the artifacts and the deployment by repeating the process that occurred in Union in a different environment.

If a failure occurs in Union, Rehearsal serves a different purpose. When you submit a new change and it fixes the break in Union, you know that a sequence of two changes, one that breaks the system, and one that comes after and fixes it, results in a healthy system. You do not yet know what happens when you apply the cumulative change to an environment that never saw the failure. The Rehearsal stage provides that environment.

Delivered is the final stage of the pipeline. What "delivered" means for your system is up to you. It could mean deploying the change so that it is live and receiving production traffic, or it might mean publishing a set of artifacts so they are accessible for your customers.


Congratulations! You now have a functioning Chef Delivery pipeline.

[COMMENT] In this tutorial, you approved and delivered your own changes. In practice, you'll need to decide with your organization the criteria for approving and shipping changes. At Chef, we follow the "four eyes" rule, where a total of four eyes is required to approve a code change. After two people approve a code change, and there are no unresolved issues, the change can be approved and move to the next pipeline stage.

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 8. Integrate the change to your local master branch

When you clicked **Approve** during the Verify stage, Chef Delivery merged the `add-delivery-config` branch into `master` on Delivery's Git server. Now you need to pull Delivery's updated `master` into your local `master` branch.

First, switch to the `master` branch.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is ahead of 'delivery/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
```

Now pull the latest from Delivery to your local repo.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo\awesome_customers_delivery
$ git pull --prune
From ssh://delivery-demo@10.0.0.12:8989/delivery-demo/delivery-demo/awesome_customers_delivery
 x [deleted]         (none)     -> delivery/_for/master/add-delivery-config
remote: Counting objects: 1, done.
remote: Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (1/1), done.
   c0d2305..d1d3eac  master     -> delivery/master
Updating 36625be..d1d3eac
Fast-forward
 .delivery/config.json | 15 +++++++++++++++
 1 file changed, 15 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .delivery/config.json
```

The `--prune` option removes references to any remote-tracking branches that no longer exist on the remote server. `delivery/_for/master/add-delivery-config` is an intermediate branch that Delivery creates as part of the integration process.

### A note about Git remotes

To help distinguish between remotes pulled from other servers, Delivery and the delivery command line tool look for a remote named `delivery` to identify the remote associated with Delivery's repository for this project. The `delivery init` command sets up the `delivery` remote for you.

`origin` refers to the original remote on GitHub and `delivery` refers to the new remote that's hosted on Delivery's Git server. Delivery does not interact with the `origin` remote.

To see this, run `git remote -v` to see your remote repositories.

```ps
# ~/delivery-demo/awesome_customers_delivery
$ git remote -v
delivery        ssh://tpetchel@delivery-demo@10.0.0.12:8989/delivery-demo/delivery-demo/awesome_customers_delivery (fetch)
delivery        ssh://tpetchel@delivery-demo@10.0.0.12:8989/delivery-demo/delivery-demo/awesome_customers_delivery (push)
origin  https://github.com/learn-chef/awesome_customers_delivery.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/learn-chef/awesome_customers_delivery.git (push)
```

You can also run `git remote show delivery` to see that `git pull` merges changes from Delivery's `master` branch. 

```ps
# ~/delivery-demo/awesome_customers_delivery
$ git remote show delivery
* remote delivery
  Fetch URL: ssh://tpetchel@delivery-demo@10.0.0.12:8989/delivery-demo/delivery-demo/awesome_customers_delivery
  Push  URL: ssh://tpetchel@delivery-demo@10.0.0.12:8989/delivery-demo/delivery-demo/awesome_customers_delivery
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branch:
    master tracked
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    master merges with remote master
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    master pushes to master (up to date)
```

In practice, you might have just one remote &ndash; `delivery`. The `origin` remote exists only as a way for you to obtain starter code that we provide for you.

Also remember that you don't have to use Delivery's Git server. We do so for learning purposes and because using the Git server that Delivery already provides is the easiest way to get started.

## How to delete your project

If you ever need to start over, or you complete the tutorial and want to delete this project, you'll need to log in to the Chef Delivery server (for example, over SSH) and run the `delivery-ctl delete-project` command.

The `delivery-ctl delete-project` command takes your enterprise, organization, and project names as arguments, like this.

```bash
$ sudo delivery-ctl delete-project ENTERPRISE ORGANIZATION PROJECT
```

Here's how to delete the `awesome_customers_delivery` project in the tutorial environment:

```bash
$ sudo delivery-ctl delete-project delivery-demo delivery-demo awesome_customers_delivery
Successfully deleted project: 'delivery-demo/delivery-demo/awesome_customers_delivery'
```
