In this tutorial you installed Chef Delivery, validated it, created a build cookbook, and updated the `awesome_customers` cookbook to add two features to the Customers web application. Finally, you tested the cookbook locally and then submitted it to Chef Delivery where it moved through the pipeline all the way to its final destination, a Chef server.

Along the way, you learned about a Delivery pipeline's stages and phases. You configured them to run automated tests and to publish to specific targets. As bonuses, you got to try out Chef provisioning and practice your Git skills.

-----

After verifying the change to the sample web application, you and your team can practice what you learned either by submitting and verifying additional changes to the web application cookbook or its build cookbook, or by setting up and running your own project through the Delivery pipeline.

(Something about team collaboration, code review, deciding on the change, etc.)

-ran through this using our sample project
-but what you really care about is _your_ cookbook, application , or service.
-try this as a team.
-Go to chef.io/delivery and click **Request Demo** to talk to us about your needs, questions, etc.
