In this tutorial you installed Chef Delivery in an AWS environment and created a build cookbook that deploys a Chef cookbook. You used the `delivery-truck` cookbook to automatically push your cookbook to the Chef server and run `chef-client` on your node. You also implemented the smoke phase to help verify that your web site is up and running.

Along the way, you learned about a Delivery pipeline's stages and phases. You configured them to run automated tests and to publish your changes. As bonuses, you got to practice your Git skills.
