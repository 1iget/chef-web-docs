[CALLOUT networks/team-members-workstation.svg] You'll perform this part from the Windows workstation that's part of the automated Delivery installation.

In this part, you perform two administrative tasks &ndash; create the origanization and add a user account.

An organization enables you to group related projects and provide scope for authorization rules. User accounts enable end users to access Chef Delivery through its web interface or from the command line.

Here's what you'll do:

1. [Connect to the Windows workstation](#step1)
1. [Log in to the Delivery web interface](#step2)
1. [Create the organization](#step3)
1. [Add a user](#step4)

[START_BOX]

## 1. Connect to the Windows workstation

Create an RDP connection to your workstation. Connect as **Administrator**. The password is **P4ssw0rd**.

[Connecting to Your Windows Instance Using RDP](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/connecting_to_windows_instance.html)

You may find it easier to continue this tutorial by opening this page in a browser from your RDP connection. We recommend that you use Google Chrome, which is preinstalled. When prompted, set Chrome as the default web browser.

[COMMENT] In practice, an administrator would typically perform these tasks from his or her own workstation. However, the automated setup requires users to access Chef Delivery from a system that's connected to the virtual private network (VPC).

## 2. Log in to the Delivery web interface

[PRODNOTE] Need to show the user the final generated admin password here. Reviewers: SSH to WorkstationPubIP and run `chef exec rake info:delivery_creds` from the `/home/ec2-user/delivery-cluster-master` directory to get the admin creds.

Open Google Chrome. When prompted, set Chrome as the default web browser.

Navigate to [https://10.0.0.12](https://10.0.0.12). On the welcome page, enter **delivery-demo** in the text box and click **Go to My Enterprise**.

Then use your `admin` credentials to log in.

You'll see the Delivery dashboard.

[START_BOX]

## 3. Create the organization

Select **Organizations** from the drop-down menu in the upper right corner.

In the text box, enter **delivery-demo**. Then click **Save & Close**.

[START_BOX]

## 4. Add a user

Now you'll add a user.

Select **Users** from the drop-down menu in the upper right corner.

![](delivery/web_ui_admin_users.png)

Click **+**, then fill in the fields. If you're setting up the account for someone else, enter an initial password and then give that person the username and password.

Leave the **Enter SSH Public Key** field blank &ndash; the user will set that up in the next part. 

In practice, you would determine the appropriate [roles and permissions](https://docs.chef.io/release/delivery/delivery_users_and_roles.html#roles-and-permissions) for your user. For now, select all roles except for **admin**.

When you're done, click **Save & Close**.
