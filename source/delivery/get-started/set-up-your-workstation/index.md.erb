[CALLOUT networks/team-members-workstation.svg] You'll perform this part from the Windows workstation that's part of the automated Delivery installation.

In the previous parts, you or your system administrator set up a Chef Delivery system and added an organization and a user. Now you're ready to use Delivery. You'll interact with Delivery from your workstation, but first you'll need to set it up.

[COMMENT] If someone else installed Chef Delivery for you, [review the installation](/delivery/get-started/install-chef-delivery#step1) to get a sense of what components are involved and how they fit together.

The Windows workstation comes preconfigured with Git for Windows and the Chef DK. Here you perform these tasks to complete your setup.

1. [Connect to your Windows workstation and open PowerShell](#step1)
1. [Create a working directory](#step2)
1. [Update your Delivery user with an SSH public key](#step3)
1. [Install the Chef Delivery command-line interface (CLI) tools](#step4)
1. [Connect the Delivery CLI to the Chef Delivery server](#step5)
1. [Authenticate access to Delivery's Git server](#step6)
1. [Set your Git identity](#step7)

[COMMENT] In this tutorial, you're using a Windows workstation. But a user's workstaton [can run Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux](https://docs.chef.io/release/delivery/install_delivery_ssh.html#install-delivery-cli).

[START_BOX]

## 1. Connect to your Windows workstation and open PowerShell

Create an RDP connection to your workstation. Connect as **Administrator**. The password is **P4ssw0rd**.

[Connecting to Your Windows Instance Using RDP](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/connecting_to_windows_instance.html)

You may find it easier to continue this tutorial by opening this page in a browser from your RDP connection. We recommend that you use Google Chrome, which is preinstalled. When prompted, set Chrome as the default web browser.

Now open a Windows PowerShell window. From the task bar, right click the PowerShell icon and choose **Run as Administrator**.

If you prefer to change your password, you can do so like this.

```ps
$ net user Administrator *
Type a password for the user:
Retype the password to confirm:
The command completed successfully.
```

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 2. Create a working directory

Now set up a directory to work in. This is where your Delivery user settings and project will go.

```ps
# ~
$ mkdir ~\delivery-demo

    Directory: C:\Users\Administrator


Mode                LastWriteTime     Length Name
----                -------------     ------ ----
d----          3/4/2016   2:54 PM            delivery-demo

$ cd ~\delivery-demo
```

Now is also a good time to open up a text editor. [Atom](https://atom.io) is preinstalled. Open it like this.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo
$ atom .
```

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 3. Update your Delivery user with an SSH public key

You need to associate your public SSH key with your Delivery user. This key enables you to authenticate requests to Delivery from the command line.

If someone else set up the account for you, ask that person for your username and initial password. If you do not have a Delivery user set up, [do so now](/delivery/get-started/create-the-organization-and-add-a-user#step4).

Start by generating an SSH key. Run this from your PowerShell prompt. You can replace you@example.com with your email address. Press Enter when prompted.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "you@example.com"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/Administrator/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/c/Users/Administrator/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/Administrator/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/Administrator/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:MVAmN/3Y0dW82pBnZ7doI5MRyGEHzUrnqXTgOSZAj7A tpetchel@chef.io
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|   ...o.*=*. . oo|
|    o.o=.*o=. . o|
|   E ...= *+o.. .|
|       . X.=oo ++|
|        S + o B.+|
|         . + = o |
|            + .  |
|                 |
|                 |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Now copy the public part of your SSH key, <% fp '~\\\\.ssh\id_rsa.pub' %>, to the clipboard. You can open the file in a text editor or run this from your PowerShell prompt.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo
$ Get-Content ~\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | clip
```

Next, log into the Chef Delivery web interface. Google Chrome comes preconfigured with this page as its home page. If you closed this tab, navigate to [https://10.0.0.12/e/delivery-demo](https://10.0.0.12/e/delivery-demo). When prompted, set Chrome as the default web browser.

You'll see a warning regarding the Deliver server's security certificate.

<img style="max-width:100%;" src="/assets/images/delivery/accept_server_certificate.png"/>

Accept the certificate by clicking **Advanced** and then **Proceed to 10.0.0.12**. Delivery comes with a self-signed certificate. In a production environment, you would typically set up a certificate chain that's rooted by a trusted certificate authority (CA) to enable the server to verify its authenticity.

On the next page, enter your username and initial password.

Next, select **Users** from the drop-down menu in the upper right corner.

![](delivery/web_ui_users.png)

Select your username and then paste your SSH key into the text area under **Security Information**. If you were assigned an initial password, change it and save your profile.

## 4. Install the Delivery CLI

You're now set up to access Delivery from the web interface. The web interface is where you manage your profile and review and approve changes made by others. Now you need to set up the Delivery command-line interface (CLI). The CLI enables you to submit new changes and pull down changes made by others.

Follow these steps to install the CLI. In the next step, you'll connect the CLI to your Delivery user account.

1. [Download the Delivery CLI installer for Windows](https://s3.amazonaws.com/delivery-packages/cli/delivery-cli-latest.msi).
1. Click the package and install.

The installer adds the path to the `delivery` executable to your system PATH. Either open a new PowerShell window and `cd` to your <% fp '~\delivery-demo' %> directory or run this command to update the PATH in your current session.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo
$ $env:Path = $env:Path + ";C:\chef\delivery-cli\bin"
```

Finally, verify that you can access the CLI.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo
$ delivery --help
delivery.exe 2015-10-29T18:40:48Z (cb6635d)

USAGE:
        delivery.exe [FLAGS] [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help          Prints help information
        --no-spinner    Disable the spinner
    -V, --version       Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    api         Helper to call Delivery's HTTP API
    checkout    Create a local branch tracking an in-progress change
    clone       Clone a project repository
    diff        Display diff for a change
    help        Prints this message
    init        Add delivery remote to this git repo (and lot's more!)
    job         Run one or more phase jobs
    review      Submit current branch for review
    setup       Write a config file capturing specified options
    token       Create a local API token
```

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 5. Connect the Delivery CLI to the Chef Delivery server

Next, you'll run the `delivery setup` command to configure the CLI to contact the Delivery server. The command creates a configuration file named <% fp '.delivery/cli.toml' %>.

The placement of the `.delivery` directory in your file hierarchy is significant. Like Git, the delivery CLI searches the current directory and parent directories for its server settings. Because server settings are unique to an organization, we recommend that you create a directory for each organization you belong to and run the `delivery setup` command from that directory.

From your command prompt, configure the CLI to contact the Delivery server at <code class="placeholder">10.0.0.12</code>, replacing <code class="placeholder">USER</code> with your username.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo
$ delivery setup --server=10.0.0.12 --ent=delivery-demo --org=delivery-demo --user=USER
Chef Delivery
Loading configuration from C:\Users\Administrator\delivery-demo
Writing configuration to C:\Users\Administrator\delivery-demo\.delivery\cli.toml
New configuration
-----------------
api_protocol = "https"
enterprise = "delivery-demo"
git_port = "8989"
organization = "delivery-demo"
pipeline = "master"
server = "10.0.0.12"
user = "USER"
```

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 6. Authenticate access to Delivery's Git server

As a verification step, authenticate access to Delivery's Git server, which by default runs on port 8989.

Run this command, replacing replacing <code class="placeholder">USER</code> with your username. Enter 'yes' when prompted.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo
$ ssh -l USER@delivery-demo -p 8989 10.0.0.12
The authenticity of host '[10.0.0.12]:8989 ([10.0.0.12]:8989)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is ba:db:0c:97:f8:d4:6d:0f:0b:57:0d:0f:0e:a4:15:01.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[10.0.0.12]:8989' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
channel 0: protocol error: close rcvd twice
Hi USER@delivery-demo! You've successfully authenticated, but Chef Delivery does not provide shell access.
                      Connection to 10.0.0.12 closed.
```

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 7. Set your Git identity

Finally, run `git config` to set your [Git identity](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup#Your-Identity). Git includes this information as metadata when you commit changes.

If you have an existing Git account, such as with GitHub, you can use the same information here.

Here's an example.

```ps
# ~\delivery-demo
$ git config --global user.name "John Smith"
$ git config --global user.email jsmith@example.com
```

Your workstation is now set up.
