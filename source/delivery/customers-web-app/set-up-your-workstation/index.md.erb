[CALLOUT networks/team-members-workstation.svg] Perform this part from a team member's workstation.

In the previous lesson, you or your system administrator set up a Chef Delivery cluster. Now you're ready to use it. You'll interact with Chef Delivery from your workstation, but first you'll need to set it up.

[PRODNOTE] Call out here which operating systems we support. Also recommend using a VM / warning about nested virtualization.

[COMMENT] If your administrator installed Chef Delivery, review [the installation at a glance](/delivery/customers-web-app/install-chef-delivery#theinstallationataglance) to get a sense of what components are involved and how they fit together.

[START_BOX]

## Workstation setup overview

You'll start by [gathering some information about your Delivery installation]().

Then you'll install these software packages:

* [Git]()
* [Chef DK]()
* [knife-push]()
* [Delivery command-line tools]()
* Optionally, [VirtualBox and Vagrant]()

Then you'll perform these tasks to complete your setup.

* [Associate a public SSH key with your Delivery user]()
* [Connect the Delivery CLI to the Chef Delivery server]()
* [Generate a Delivery API token]()
* [Authenticate access to Delivery's Git server]()
* Optionally, set up your Chef server account [VirtualBox and Vagrant]()

DON"T FORGET TO mkdir ~/learn-chef!
