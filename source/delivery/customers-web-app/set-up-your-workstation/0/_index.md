## Gather information about your Delivery server

You'll need some information [from the previous lesson](/delivery/customers-web-app/install-chef-delivery#step3). You can get this information from your administrator if you did not perform the installation.

* The Chef server URL, for example, https://10.194.13.167/organizations/test, and logon information.
* The Chef Delivery web interface URL, for example, https://10.194.9.174/e/test/.
* Your Chef Delivery username and initial password.

Also ensure that you are connected to the VPN that contains your Delivery cluster on AWS. An easy way to verify this is to connect to Chef Delivery web interface URL from a web browser. You should be able to log on using your username and initial password and access the Delivery dashboard.
