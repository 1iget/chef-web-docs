[HEADLINE] A _cookbook_ provides structure to your recipes and enables you to more easily reference external files, such as our web server's home page. In essence, a cookbook helps you stay organized.

Last time, you learned how to manage a package and a service by configuring a web server. You also added a basic web page. But there was one problem &ndash; although it helped you verify that your web server was properly configured, the code for your HTML page was embedded in the Chef recipe.

Let's create a _cookbook_ to make our web server recipe easier to manage.
