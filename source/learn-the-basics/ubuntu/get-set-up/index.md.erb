The normal Chef workflow involves managing servers remotely from your workstation. But in this tutorial, you'll log on to a server and manage it directly to get a feel for how Chef works.

<% reveal_modal('chef-workflow', 'Learn more about the Chef workflow') do %>

<%= partial 'layouts/partials/chef_workflow', :locals => { server_name: "Ubuntu" } %>

<% end %>


The easiest way to get started is to use a free trial Ubuntu 14.04 virtual machine that we provide. The virtual machine runs in your browser and has the set of Chef tools, called the Chef DK, and several popular text editors pre-installed. You can also [set up your own server](/learn-the-basics/ubuntu/set-up-your-own-server) to use with this tutorial. 

[START_BOX]

## 1. Launch a free trial Ubuntu 14.04 virtual machine

Let us provide an Ubuntu virtual machine with the Chef DK installed for you. Just click the button below.

## 2. Prepare a text editor

Because Chef uses _code_ to express infrastructure policy, it's important that you use a text editor that provides features such as syntax highlighting and line numbering.

After you launch your Ubuntu server, open a command prompt and bring up a text editor. The virtual machine comes with `emacs`, `nano`, and `vim` pre-installed. If you prefer another text editor, install it now.

If you're new to using command-line text editors on Ubuntu, here are some resources to help get you started.

* Vim: [Interactive Vim tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/)

## 3. Ensure the apt cache is up to date

Now ensure that your system's package index contains the latest list of what packages are available.

You'll learn how to use Chef to do this automatically in a later tutorial, but for now run this command on your virtual machine to manually update the `apt` cache.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update

Now that you have your virtual machine with the Chef DK and a text editor set up, let's use Chef to configure a file, a kind of _resource_, on it.
