The normal Chef workflow involves managing servers remotely from your workstation. But in this tutorial, you'll log on to a server and manage it directly to get a feel for how Chef works.

<% reveal_modal('chef-workflow', 'Learn more about the Chef workflow') do %>

<%= partial 'layouts/partials/chef_workflow', :locals => { server_name: "Ubuntu" } %>

<% end %>


The easiest way to get started is to use a free trial Ubuntu 14.04 virtual machine that we provide. The virtual machine runs in your browser and has the Chef tools and several popular text editors pre-installed.

You can also [set up your own server](/learn-the-basics/ubuntu/set-up-your-own-server) to use with this tutorial. Or you can complete this tutorial using the virtual machine that we provide and then follow the tutorial a second time using your own server so that you can experience Chef in your own environment.

## 1. Launch a free trial Ubuntu 14.04 server

## 2. Prepare a text editor

Because Chef uses _code_ to express infrastructure policy, it's important that you use a text editor that provides features such as syntax highlighting and line numbering.

After you launch your Ubuntu server, open a command prompt and bring up a text editor. The virtual machine comes with `emacs`, `nano`, and `vim` pre-installed. If you prefer another text editor, install it now.

If you're new to using command-line text editors on Ubuntu, here are some resources to help get you started.

* Emacs: [Absolute Beginner's Guide to Emacs](http://www.jesshamrick.com/2012/09/10/absolute-beginners-guide-to-emacs/)
* Nano: [The Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Nano, the Linux Command-Line Text Editor](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/)
* Vim: [Interactive Vim tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/)

Now that you have your virtual machine with the Chef tools and a text editor set up, let's use Chef to configure a file, a kind of _resource_, on it.
