You can continue to experiment with the virtual machine that we provided for this lesson. When you're done you can close the connection - we'll no longer be using that virtual machine.

We recommend that next you work through [Learn to manage a node](/manage-a-node/ubuntu), where you'll experience managing a server remotely from your workstation. We'll bring the virtual machine!
