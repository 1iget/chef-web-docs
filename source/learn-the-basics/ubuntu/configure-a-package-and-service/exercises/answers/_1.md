No, they are not. Remember that Chef applies resources in the order they appear. So the first recipe ensures that the `apache2` package is installed and then configures the service. The second recipe configures the service and then ensures the package is installed.

The second recipe may not work as you'd expect because the `service` resource will fail if the package is not yet installed.
