First, you can verify that Apache is running.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ curl -I localhost
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 05 Feb 2015 22:40:54 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)

Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 11510

```

Here's the code that stops and disables the Apache service.

```ruby
# webserver.rb
service 'apache2' do
  action [:stop, :disable]
end
```

Now you can run the recipe and verify that the service is no longer running.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ sudo chef-client --local-mode webserver.rb
