Now let's start the Apache service and enable it when the server boots. Modify <code class="file-path">webserver.rb</code> to look like this.

```ruby
# ~/chef-repo/webserver.rb
package 'apache2'

service 'apache2' do
  action [:start, :enable]
end
```

This code uses a list to declare multiple actions.

Now apply it.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ sudo chef-apply webserver.rb
Recipe: (chef-apply cookbook)::(chef-apply recipe)
  * package[apache2] action install (up to date)
  * service[apache2] action start (up to date)
  * service[apache2] action enable (up to date)
```

The package is already installed, so there's nothing to do. Similarly, the service is already started and enabled. On some Linux distros, Apache is not started or enabled as it is installed. With Chef, this is easy to verify.
