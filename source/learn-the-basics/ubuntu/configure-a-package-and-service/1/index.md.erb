Let's install the Apache package, `apache2`. From your <code class="file-path">~/chef-repo</code> directory, add this recipe to a file named <code class="file-path">webserver.rb</code>.

```ruby
# ~/chef-repo/webserver.rb
package 'apache2'
```

We don't need to specify an action because `install` is the default.

Now run `chef-apply` to apply the recipe.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ sudo chef-apply webserver.rb
Recipe: (chef-apply cookbook)::(chef-apply recipe)
  * package[apache2] action install
    - install version 2.4.6-2ubuntu2.2 of package apache2
```

[COMMENT] `sudo` is required because this command installs a package and therefore must be run with root privileges. If you're running as root on your own machine, you can omit `sudo` from the command.

Run the recipe a second time.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ sudo chef-apply webserver.rb
Recipe: (chef-apply cookbook)::(chef-apply recipe)
  * package[apache2] action install (up to date)
  ```

You see that Chef does no work because there's nothing to do &ndash; the package is already installed.
