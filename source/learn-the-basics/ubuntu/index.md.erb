Chef helps you express your infrastructure policy &ndash; how your software is delivered and maintained on your servers &ndash; as code. When infrastructure is code, it becomes more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.

In practice, you use Chef to manage your servers remotely, typically from a Linux, Mac OS, or Windows workstation. But for learning purposes, you'll start by managing a server directly to get a feel for how Chef works.

In the first step, you'll set up your own server or use one that we provide. You'll use this same server in the 3 steps that follow.
