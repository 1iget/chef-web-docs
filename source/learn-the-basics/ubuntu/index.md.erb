Chef helps you express your infrastructure policy &ndash; how your software is delivered and maintained on your servers &ndash; as code. When infrastructure is code, it becomes more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.

A great way to get started with Chef is to log in to a server, or _node_, and configure it directly.

After completing this tutorial, you should be able to:

* describe what happens when Chef runs.
* write Chef code that defines a basic policy.
* apply that policy to a server.

In the next step, you'll install the Chef tools and a text editor on your own machine, or use a virtual machine in the cloud that we provide that already has everything set up. You'll use that machine in the lessons that follow.
