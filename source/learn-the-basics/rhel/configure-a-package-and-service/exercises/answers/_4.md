First, you can verify that Apache is running.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ curl -I localhost
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 25 Feb 2015 07:41:43 GMT

Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 58
Connection: close

```

Here's the code that stops and disables the Apache service.

```ruby
# webserver.rb
service 'httpd' do
  action [:stop, :disable]
end
```

Now you can run the recipe and verify that the service is no longer running.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ sudo chef-client --local-mode webserver.rb
