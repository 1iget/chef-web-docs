The normal Chef workflow involves managing servers remotely from your workstation. But in this tutorial, you'll log in to a server and manage it directly to get a feel for how Chef works.

The easiest way to get started is to use a free trial CentOS 7 virtual machine that we provide. The virtual machine runs in your browser and has the set of Chef tools, called the Chef DK, and several popular text editors pre-installed. You can also [set up your own server](/learn-the-basics/rhel/set-up-your-own-server) to use with this tutorial.

## 1. Launch a free trial CentOS 7 virtual machine

Let us provide a CentOS virtual machine with the Chef DK installed for you. Just click the button below.

## 2. Prepare a text editor

Because Chef uses _code_ to express infrastructure policy, it's important that you use a text editor that provides features such as syntax highlighting and line numbering.

After you launch your CentOS server, open a command prompt and bring up a text editor. The virtual machine comes with `emacs`, `nano`, and `vim` pre-installed. If you prefer another text editor, install it now.

If you're new to using command-line text editors on CentOS, here are some resources to help get you started.

* Emacs: [Absolute Beginner's Guide to Emacs](http://www.jesshamrick.com/2012/09/10/absolute-beginners-guide-to-emacs/)
* Nano: [The Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Nano, the Linux Command-Line Text Editor](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/)
* Vim: [Interactive Vim tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/)

Now that you have your virtual machine with the Chef DK and a text editor set up, let's use Chef to configure a file, a kind of _resource_, on it.
