In practice, you use Chef to manage your servers remotely, typically from a Linux, Mac OS, or Windows workstation. But for learning purposes, you'll start by managing a server directly to get a feel for how Chef works.

## 1. Get a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS server

Because you'll directly modify the state of your server, we strongly suggest that you work through this tutorial in a disposable environment such as a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS virtual machine.

To ensure that the output you see matches the sample output that's shown, we recommend that you run Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 or CentOS 6.5 on your virtual machine. Ensure that you have `sudo` or root access to the instance.

If you don't have a preferred way to set up a server, here are some popular options.

AWS's [one-year free account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_US&sc_publisher=google&sc_medium=cloud_computing_b&sc_content=aws_free_e&sc_detail=aws%20free%20tier&sc_category=cloud_computing&sc_segment=73823473242&sc_matchtype=e&sc_country=US&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!73823473242!e!!g!!aws%20free%20tier&ef_id=VV3lAgAAAHK07c0y:20151119221840:s) gives you 750 hours per month of usage on the t2.micro tier.

If you're new to AWS, their [getting started guide](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/launch-a-virtual-machine/) walks you through the creation of your first Linux virtual machine.

When you're ready to continue with this tutorial, visit the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00IOYDTV6) to create a CentOS 6.5 instance. Be sure to create a [security group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html#creating-security-group) that enables inbound access on ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS).

<% accordion('vm-azure', 'Microsoft Azure') do %>

<% markdown do %>

Azure is offers a [30-day free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) for up to $200 of usage.

When you're ready to continue with this tutorial, [follow this tutorial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-tutorial-portal-rm/) to create your Linux virtual machine. At the step where you choose the VM image, search for **CentOS-based 6.5**, published by OpenLogic. Also ensure that your VM enables inbound access on ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS).

<% accordion('vm-vagrant', 'VirtualBox and Vagrant') do %>

<% markdown do %>

[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) are free virtualization tools that enable you to manage virtual machine instances. Here's how to install VirtualBox and Vagrant and bring up a CentOS 6.5 instance.

Start by installing Virtual Box and Vagrant.

### Install VirtualBox

### Install Vagrant

<%= partial 'layouts/install_vagrant' %>
<%= partial 'layouts/vagrant_centos_box' %>

## 2. Set up your virtual machine

For this tutorial, you'll need to ensure that your virtual machine can access the Internet and has ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) open to inbound traffic through the firewall. Port 80 is required because you'll set up a basic web server configuration later in this tutorial.

You'll also need two pieces of software on your virtual machine &ndash; the Chef Development Kit (Chef DK) and a good text editor.

### Verify network access

Although Chef can be run from behind the firewall, giving your virtual machine Internet access is the easiest way to install packages and perform other common tasks.

Ensure that your server can reach the Internet through your company's proxy server and firewall.

### Install the Chef Development Kit

Remember, for learning purposes, you'll start by managing a server directly. To do that, you'll install the Chef Development Kit on your virtual machine. The Chef DK provides tools that enable you to manage your servers remotely from your workstation. But it also provides tools that allow you to configure a machine directly.

Download and install the Chef DK on your virtual machine.

<%= link_to "<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i>&nbsp;Install the Chef DK", "#{chef_dk_url}", target: '_blank', class: 'accent-button radius' %>

Or, run this from the command line to install it.

```bash
$ curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -c current -P chefdk

Thank you for installing Chef Development Kit!
```

### Set up your text editor

Because Chef uses _code_ to express infrastructure policy, it's important that you use a text editor that provides features such as syntax highlighting and line numbering.

Install a text editor now. [Atom](http://atom.io) and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) are popular text editors for graphical user environments. If you prefer the command line, `emacs`, `nano`, and `vim` are popular.

Now that you have your virtual machine with the Chef tools and a text editor set up, let's use Chef to configure a file, a kind of _resource_, on it.
