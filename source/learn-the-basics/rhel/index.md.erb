Chef helps you express your infrastructure policy &ndash; how your software is delivered and maintained on your servers &ndash; as code. When infrastructure is code, it becomes more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.

After completing this lesson, you'll:

* have a basic understanding of what happens when Chef runs.
* be able to write Chef code that defines a basic policy.
* be able to apply that policy to a server.

In the next step, you'll install the Chef tools and a text editor on your own machine, or use a virtual machine in the cloud that we provide that already has everything set up. You'll use that machine in the lessons that follow.
