You can continue to experiment with the virtual machine that we provide for this lesson. When you're done you can close the connection - we'll no longer be using that virtual machine.

We recommend that next you work through [Manage a server](/manage-a-node/rhel), where you'll experience managing a server remotely from your workstation. We'll bring the virtual machine!
