If you have a machine you'd like to use that meets the [system requirements](<%= chef_docs_url %>/chef_system_requirements.html), install the [Chef Development Kit](<%= chef_dk_url %>) (ChefDK) on it now.

Or, let us provide a Windows Server virtual machine with the ChefDK installed for you. Just click the button below.
