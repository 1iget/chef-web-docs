<h2>2. Get a text editor</h2>
<p>
Because you're working in a temporary environment, Notepad is just fine for now.
</p>
<p>
Later, when you write Chef code on your workstation, we recommend that you use a text editor that provides features such as syntax highlighting and line numbering.
</p>
<p>
If you don't have a preferred text editor, we recommend <%= link_to 'Atom', 'http://atom.io', target: '_blank' %> and <%= link_to 'Sublime Text', 'http://www.sublimetext.com', target: '_blank' %>.
