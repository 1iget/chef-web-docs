## 2. Set up your working directory

When working with Chef from Windows, we recommend that you use Windows PowerShell. Open it as **Administrator**.

Create the <code class="file-path">chef-repo</code> directory under your home directory, <code class="file-path">C:\Users\Administrator</code>.

```ps
# C:\Users\Administrator
$ mkdir ~\chef-repo
```

[WINDOWS] In PowerShell, <code class="file-path">~</code> represents the current user's home directory, for example <code class="file-path">C:\Users\Administrator</code>.

Now `cd` there.

```ps
# C:\Users\Administrator
$ cd ~\chef-repo
```

[TIP] We believe typing in the code and commands is the best way to learn. If you prefer to copy and paste things and are using our free trial VM, you may find it easier to continue this tutorial by opening this page in a browser from your VM. You can also copy and paste the text into your remote session. Use the **Clipboard** <img style="box-shadow:none; margin:0; display:inline;" src="/assets/images/skytap/clipboard.png"/> command in the menu bar to copy text to your session's clipboard.
