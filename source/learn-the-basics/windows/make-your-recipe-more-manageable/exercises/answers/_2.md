`chef-apply` applies a single recipe; `chef-client` applies a cookbook.

For learning purposes, we had you start off with `chef-apply` because it helps you understand the basics quickly. In practice, `chef-apply` is useful when you want to quickly test something out. But for production purposes, you typically run `chef-client` to apply one or more cookbooks.

You'll learn in the next module how to run `chef-client` remotely from your workstation.
