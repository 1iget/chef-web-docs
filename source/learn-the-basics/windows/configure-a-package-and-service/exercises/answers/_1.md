No, they are not. Remember that Chef applies resources in the order they appear. So the first recipe ensures that IIS is installed and then configures the W3SVC service. The second recipe configures the service and then ensures IIS is installed.

The second recipe may not work as you'd expect because the `service` resource will fail if the IIS package is not yet installed.
