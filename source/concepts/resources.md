Resources are the fundamental building blocks of Chef configuration and represent a piece of the system and its desired state. Examples include:
  
  * A package that should be installed
  * A service that should be running
  * A file that should be generated

Resources are gathered into Recipes and then applied to systems via thef Chef Client. For more information, see the [Chef Documentation for Resources](http://docs.opscode.com/resource.html).
