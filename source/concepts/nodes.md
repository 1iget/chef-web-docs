Nodes represent the servers in your infrastructure that are maintained by Chef. Nodes can be physical servers, virtual machines, public or private cloud instances or network devices. A Node may belong to just one Environment within one Organization. A Node may have zero or more Roles applied to it. For more information, see the [Chef Documentation for Nodes](http://docs.opscode.com/chef_overview_nodes.html).
