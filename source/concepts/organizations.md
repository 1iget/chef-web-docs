An Organization is the top-level entity for role-based access control in Enterprise Chef. Each Organization is a completely isolated tenant that shares nothing with other Organizations. Oftentimes, organizations will represent different Companies, Business Units or Departments. For more information on Organizations, see the [Chef Documentation for Organizations](http://docs.opscode.com/server_orgs.html).
