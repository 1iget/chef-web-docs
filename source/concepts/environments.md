An _environment_ is a way to map the lifecycle of the applications and infrastructure that Chef manages. Each organization starts with a single default environment, but it is common to add environments such as development, test, staging and production.  Each environment may contain unique data attributes and versions of Chef templates and configuration files. For more information, see [About Environments](http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_environments.html).
