A cookbook is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution. Each cookbook defines a scenario, such as everything needed to install and configure MySQL, and then it contains all of the components that are required to support that scenario, including:
  
  * Templates
  * Versions
  * Metadata about recipes (including dependencies), version constraints, supported platforms, and so on
  * Custom resources and providers

For more information, see the [Chef Documentation for Cookbooks](http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbooks.html).
