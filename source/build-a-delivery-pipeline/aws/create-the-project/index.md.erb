Chef Delivery uses _projects_ to organize work across multiple teams. You can create as many projects as you need. A common approach is to have one project for each major component of your system.

Each project has its own Git repository. Chef Delivery can host the Git repository for you or you can connect Delivery to an existing Git project, such as one on GitHub.

One way to create a project is from the Delivery web interface. (To do so, select **Organizations** from the drop-down in the upper-right corner, then select your organization.)

You'll have the choice to create a new project on Delivery's Git server or connect to an existing  GitHub repository.

There's a second way to create a project, which you'll use for the Customers web application project. This process saves you the need to maintain your own Git repository, for example, in GitHub, and also gives you access to starter code for the project.

You'll start by cloning an existing project from GitHub that contains the starter code. Then you'll run the `delivery init` command to create the Delivery project. `delivery init` detects the existing Git repository and creates a copy of the `master` branch in its own Git repository on the Delivery server. Delivery also creates a default pipeline whoâ€™s target branch is `master`.

[COMMENT] If your administrator installed Chef Delivery, be sure to [set up your workstation](set-up-your-workstation/) before starting this lesson.
