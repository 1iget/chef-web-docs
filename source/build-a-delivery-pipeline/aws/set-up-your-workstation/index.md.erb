[CALLOUT networks/team-members-workstation.svg] Perform this part from a team member's workstation.

In the previous lesson, you or your system administrator set up a Chef Delivery cluster. Now you're ready to use it. You'll interact with Chef Delivery from your workstation, but first you'll need to set it up.

[COMMENT] If your administrator installed Chef Delivery, review [the installation at a glance](/build-a-delivery-pipeline/aws/install-chef-delivery#theinstallationataglance) to get a sense of what components are involved and how they fit together.
