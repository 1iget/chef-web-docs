At this point, you've validated that your pipeline works and you've configured it with your build cookbook. You're ready to use Chef Delivery for what it was intended &ndash; moving changes quickly and safely all the way from your workstation to production.

In this lesson, we'll add two new features to the Customers web application by changing the `awesome_customers` cookbook. The first change to our cookbook adds more rows of data. The second change adds an interactive control that displays where our customers are on a globe.

We'll test our changes locally. Then, we'll submit our changes to our Git repo and trigger the Delivery pipeline. Because it's a good idea to make changes in as small a batch as possible, we'll verify, build, and run acceptance tests for each change separately. We'll deliver them together to Union.
