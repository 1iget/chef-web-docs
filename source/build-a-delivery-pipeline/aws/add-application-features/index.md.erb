At this point, you've validated that your pipeline works and you've configured it with your build cookbook. You're ready to use Chef Delivery for what it was intended &ndash; moving changes quickly and safely all the way from your workstation to production.

In this lesson, we'll add two new features to the Customers web application by changing the `awesome_customers` cookbook. The first change to our cookbook adds more rows of data. The second change adds an interactive control that displays where our customers are on a globe.

Before we submit our changes to our Git repo and trigger the Delivery pipeline, we'll use [Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci), which comes with the Chef DK, to verify our changes on a local virtual machine that resembles our production environment. ([Learn more in this tutorial](/local-development/rhel).)

After we verify that the changes are good locally, we'll submit our changes to our Git repo and trigger the Delivery pipeline. Because it's a good idea to make changes in as small a batch as possible, we'll verify, build, and run acceptance tests for each change separately. We'll deliver them together to Union.

[COMMENT] For simplicity, we'll use VirtualBox and Vagrant, which provide local environments for you to verify your work. In practice, however, you might use Test Kitchen's [EC2](https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-ec2) driver to more closely match your stages' environments in AWS.
