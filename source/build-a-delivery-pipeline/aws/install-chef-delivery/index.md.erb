In this lesson, you'll set up Chef Delivery with the [delivery-cluster](TODO) cookbook and infrastructure in Amazon Web Services (AWS). You'll create a Chef server, a Chef Delivery server and build nodes that run jobs scheduled by Chef Delivery. In preparation, you'll determine the AWS configuration details for the servers. Then, you'll run automation to set up the full Chef Delivery cluster. You'll create an organization and one or more user accounts.
