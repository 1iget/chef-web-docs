Before we set up your build pipeline, let's take a few moments to familiarize yourself with your delivery cluster. This is also a good opportunity to make sure you have everything you need and that everything's working.

Make sure you have the [information about your delivery cluster](/build-a-delivery-pipeline/rhel/get-set-up/#step5) handy.
