## Exercises

[PRODNOTE] Just throwing out a few possible calls to action. What of this list should we keep? What else can we add? Do we have documentation or other supporting resources do we have? Can/should we point to purchasing information?

Now that you've worked with the basics, here's your chance to make Chef Delivery your own. Here are some ideas to get started.

* Add a new feature to the Customers web application and watch it move down the pipeline. Even a small change to the CSS or the addition of a new unit test is enough to experience Chef Delivery on your own. Remember to verify and test your changes locally before you submit new features into the pipeline.
* Invite others to your org. Submit a change and apply your established review process to approve and deliver new features.
* Stand up a second Delivery cluster that includes additional features, such as:
  * multiple build nodes. We recommend 3 for a complete setup.
  * Chef Supermarket.
  * Chef Analytics.
  * LDAP integration.
  * integration with your existing source control system, such as GitHub.
* Clone an existing project &ndash; this can be a cookbook, application, or service &ndash; into Chef Delivery's integrated Git server. Write a build cookbook that's tailored to how you test and verify new features, publish your build artifacts, and deploy to your infrastructure environments. Once you have a solid pipeline in place, you can integrate Chef Delivery with your existing source control system.
