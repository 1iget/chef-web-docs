First, you'll set up your workstation and install Chef Delivery on your network. Here's the process you'll follow:

1. get either a full or a trial license key.
1. plan what systems and features you want to include in your installation.
1. install Chef Delivery in your network.
1. set up your workstation for local development and to communicate with your Chef Delivery installation.
1. prepare your Acceptance, Union, Rehearsal, and Delivered stages.

[TIP] If you already have Chef Delivery installed on your network, you can continue to the [next lesson](/build-a-delivery-pipeline/rhel/create-the-project). For evaluation and learning purposes, you can also use your existing license key to set up a second installation.
