## Before you begin

In this tutorial, you'll add new features to an existing web application. Before you submit your features to the pipeline, you'll verify your work on a virtual machine that resembles your production environment.

Ensure that your workstation supports and is configured to use CPU virtualization. This setting is typically configured through your system's BIOS.

If you're using a virtual machine as your workstation through a program such as VMWare Fusion, ensure that nested virtualization is enabled on the virtual machine.

Also ensure that your workstation meets the [system requirements](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/End-user_documentation) requirements for running VirtualBox.

If you are unable to run virtual machines from your workstation, you can skip the steps that involve verifying the changes locally.
