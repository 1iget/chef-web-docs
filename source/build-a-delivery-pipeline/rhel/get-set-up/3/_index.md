## 3. Install Chef Delivery

Follow the instructions in the installation procedure. To clarify:

* Either use a provisioning node or your workstation to install the Delivery cluster.
* Use `test` as the environment name.
* Remember that installing Chef Supermarket is optional.
* Remember that installing Chef Analytics is optional.
* Remember that, for this tutorial, you only need one build node.
* Creating an internal user is fine.
* When you add a user, you can give all permissions.
* When you create an organization, you can enter a name that matches your org (for example, `dev`), or `learn-chef`.
* You don't need to validate the installation. We'll do that here.
* This tutorial uses <code class="file-path">~/Development</code> as its working directory, but you can choose a directory that best suits you. Just remember to change the paths that we show as necessary.
