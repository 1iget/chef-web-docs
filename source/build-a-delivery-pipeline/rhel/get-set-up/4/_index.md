## 4. Install Chef Delivery

Follow the instructions in the installation procedure. To clarify:

* Use the working directory you created in step 3.
* Either use a provisioning node or your workstation to install the Delivery cluster.
* Use test as the environment name.
* Remember that installing Chef Supermarket is optional.
* Remember that installing Chef Analytics is optional.
* Remember that, for this tutorial, you only need one build node.
* Creating an internal user is fine.
* When you add a user, you can give all permissions.
* When you create an organization, you can enter a name that matches your org (for example, dev), or learn-chef.
* You don't need to validate the installation. We'll do that here.
