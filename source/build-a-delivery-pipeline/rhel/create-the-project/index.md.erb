# ~/Development
$ git clone https://github.com/learn-chef/build-a-delivery-pipeline-rhel.git

* Run `delivery token`. Enter your password when prompted.

[PRODNOTE] This step seems borked. Folks say you need to run this along with `delivery setup`, one dir above. Need to reconcile.

```bash
# ~/Development/build-a-delivery-pipeline-rhel
$ delivery token
Chef Delivery
Loading configuration from /home/thomaspetchel/Development/build-a-delivery-pipeline-rhel
Delivery password:

saved API token to: /home/thomaspetchel/.delivery/api-tokens
```

You now have a .delivery directory.

```bash
# ~/Development/build-a-delivery-pipeline-rhel
$ tree .delivery
.delivery/
└── cli.toml

`delivery init`:

* Push to master
* Create the pipeline
* Create a branch (to add the delivery config)
* Add the Delivery configuration files
* Create a change for review

* A browser window appears. Watch it flow through the pipeline - the default actions happen.

The build is expected to fail because it needs to be set up for your [environment....]

Talk about what `delivery init` does (creates branch, creates stubs, pushes for review)
