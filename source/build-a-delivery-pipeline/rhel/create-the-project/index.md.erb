Chef Delivery uses _projects_ to organize work across multiple teams. You can create as many projects as you need. A common approach is to have one project for each major component of your system.

Each project has its own Git repository. Chef Delivery can host the Git repository for you or you can connect Chef Delivery to an existing Git project, such as one on GitHub.

To save you the need to maintain your own Git repository, for example, in GitHub, we'll use Delivery's Git server. You'll start by cloning a repository that contains the `awesome_customers` cookbook to your workstation. Then you'll run the `delivery init` command from your workstation. This command creates a new project, a Git repository, a pipeline, and an initial `master` branch that's based off of the existing `master` branch.

[COMMENT] Another way to start would be to create the project from the Chef Delivery web interface and run the `delivery clone` command to pull the empty repository down to your workstation.
