### Homebrew
Because OSX does not ship with a package manager, you will need to install [homebrew][homebrew].

1. Open Terminal from `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal`

1. Install [homebrew][homebrew] by running this command in Terminal:

        $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"

    [WARN] If you've install MacPorts, you'll need to [uninstall MacPorts][uninstall-macports] first!
