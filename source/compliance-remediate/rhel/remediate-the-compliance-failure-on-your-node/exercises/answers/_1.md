Your implementation will depend on your organization's requirements and goals. You might follow a common requirements standard, or you might have unique requirements that are specific to your company.

Remember, the common workflow to resolve compliance issues is to:

1. [Assess your node](/compliance-assess/rhel/scan-your-node-for-compliance/) to identify potential compliance risk.
1. [Remediate the issue](/compliance-remediate/rhel/remediate-the-compliance-failure-on-a-local-virtual-machine/) on a local virtual machine.
1. [Apply the configuration](/compliance-remediate/rhel/remediate-the-compliance-failure-on-your-node/) to your node and re-run your compliance scan to verify that it's resolved. 

You can also use community cookbooks on Chef Supermarket to perform many common tasks. The [Manage a basic web application](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/) tutorial shows you how.
