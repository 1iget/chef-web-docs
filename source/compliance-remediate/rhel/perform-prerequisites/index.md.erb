This tutorial comes in two parts.

In the first part, [Remediate the compliance failure on a local virtual machine](/compliance-remediate/rhel/remediate-the-compliance-failure-on-a-local-virtual-machine/), you'll replicate and remediate the failure of the **Set SSH Protocol to 2** rule on a local virtual machine.

In the second part, [Remediate the compliance failure on your node](/compliance-remediate/rhel/remediate-the-compliance-failure-on-your-node/), you'll apply the remediation to your node and rerun the compliance scan to verify that the node's SSH configuration satisfies the **Set SSH Protocol to 2** rule.

Both parts use Chef and require a basic understanding of:

* Chef's _test and repair_ approach.
* working with a Chef server.
* local development using Test Kitchen.
* working with Chef Compliance.

Use the following sections as a guide to learning the prerequisite skills.

[START_BOX]

## Chef's test and repair approach

If you're new to Chef, we recommend that you first work through the [Learn the Chef basics](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/rhel/free/) tutorial. You'll learn about Chef's test and repair approach by writing a Chef cookbook that brings up a basic web server configuration. We provide a free CentOS virtual machine that runs in your browser.

## Working with a Chef server

If you don't have a Chef server, the [Manage a node](/manage-a-node/rhel/) tutorial gets you started. You'll learn how Chef server acts as a central repository for your cookbooks as well as for information about every node it manages. You'll sign up for hosted Chef and learn how to manage a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS server remotely from your workstation.

As an optional step, you can follow the [Install and manage your own Chef server](/install-and-manage-your-own-chef-server/linux/) tutorial to learn how to set up a Chef server that you manage.

## Local development using Test Kitchen

If you're not familiar with local development using Test Kitchen, check out the [Develop your infrastructure code locally](/local-development/rhel/) tutorial. You'll learn how to use Test Kitchen along with the virtualization tools VirtualBox and Vagrant to develop and verify your infrastructure code _before_ you apply the configuration to your production servers.

As an optional exercise, the [Manage a basic web application](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/) tutorial provides additional hands-on practice with local development. Here, you configure a basic but complete web application using Test Kitchen. The [quickstart](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/bring-up-the-web-app-using-test-kitchen/) brings up the final configuration on a local test instance in minutes.

## Working with Chef Compliance

For this tutorial, you'll need a Chef Compliance installation and a CentOS 7 node that permits SSH-1 connections.

Be sure to complete the previous tutorial, [Assess your infrastructure with Chef Compliance](/compliance-assess/rhel/), before starting this one.

[COMMENT] This tutorial uses Chef server and Chef Compliance as standalone components. Although not required,  you can later [integrate Chef Complance with Chef server](https://docs.chef.io/integrate_compliance_chef_server.html) to enable Chef Compliance users to log in using their Chef server credentials and enable nodes to download Chef Compliance profiles, run them, and send the results back to Chef Compliance.
