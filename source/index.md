#### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is Chef?**<br>
A: Chef is an infrastructure automation and configuration management framework. Simply put, Chef is "Infrastructure as Code".

**Q: Can I use Chef with Amazon AWS, Google App Engine, Rackspace, or another cloud provider?**<br>
A: Chef supports a wide variety of cloud providers including Amazon AWS, Google App Engine, OpenStack, Rackspace, and Linode. To see if your provider is supported, visit the [Chef Docs](http://docs.opscode.com).

**Q: What are all these `.pem` files?**<br>
A: Chef uses those pem files to authenticate you against the Chef Server.

**Q: Do I need to know Ruby to use Chef?**<br>
A: No, but it helps. For more information, check out the [Just Enough Ruby for Chef](http://docs.opscode.com/just_enough_ruby_for_chef.html) section on [Chef Docs](http://docs.opscode.com).

**Q: What about Private Chef or Open Source Chef?**<br>
A: The #learnchef campaign was designed to be "the quickest path to converge". Instead of spending hours trying to get Private Chef installed, we want you to experience the full power of Chef as quickly as possible. For this reason, we recommend new Chefs register for a [free Hosted Chef](http://www.opscode.com/hosted-chef/) account and we'll take care of the Chef Server for you. While there may be some content in this guide that applies to Private Chef Server or Open Source Chef Server, #learnchef should not be considered an authoritative source for those resources. Instead, please visit the [official Opscode docs](http://docs.opscode.com).
