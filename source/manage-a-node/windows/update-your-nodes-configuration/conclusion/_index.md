That's it for this tutorial. You can continue to experiment with the virtual machine that we provided for this lesson. When you're done you can close the connection &ndash; we'll no longer be using that virtual machine.

You can also explore the [Chef management console](https://manage.chef.io). See what info's available for your nodes and what else you can do.

In the next tutorial, _Learn to manage a basic web application_, you'll use the skills you've just learned to build a basic but complete web application that uses a web server, a database, and scripting. You'll learn how to leverage cookbooks that are written by the Chef community and resolve cookbook dependencies to create cookbooks that are more reusable.

This tutorial will be available soon for Windows Server. In the meantime, you can check out the version we have for [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/) or [Ubuntu](/manage-a-web-app/ubuntu/).
