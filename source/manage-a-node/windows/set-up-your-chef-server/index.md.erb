[HEADLINE] Chef server acts as a central repository for your cookbooks as well as for information about every node it manages.<br>The `knife` command enables you to communicate with the Chef server from your workstation. The Starter Kit provides the certificates that enables `knife` to securely communicate with the Chef server.

There are two ways to work with a Chef server.

1. Install an instance on your own infrastructure.
1. Sign up for hosted Chef and let us host it for you.

Your current goal is to learn how to manage a node remotely from your workstation. The fastest way to set up a Chef server is to use hosted Chef. It takes only a few moments and is free to get started.

In production, the decision to use hosted Chef or manage your own Chef server depends on your organization's requirements and preferences. If you're interested in setting up your own Chef server, we recommend that you first complete this tutorial using hosted Chef. Then you can follow the [Learn to install and manage your own Chef server](/install-and-manage-your-own-chef-server/linux/) tutorial to set up a Chef server in your environment.
