## 2. Install the knife-windows plugin

The `knife-windows` plugin enables you to configure remote Windows Server nodes over the WinRM protocol from your workstation. Although the this plugin comes with the Chef DK, we recommend that you install the latest version. Run this command to install it.

```bash
$ chef gem install knife-windows
Fetching: knife-windows-1.2.1.gem (100%)
Successfully installed knife-windows-1.2.1
1 gem installed
```

[COMMENT] It's important that you have `knife-windows` version 1.2.1 or later.
