## 3. Set up your text editor

As you did in the previous tutorial, make sure you have a good text editor that provides features such as syntax highlighting and line numbering.

Now's a good time to make sure your favorite text editor is set up. If you don't have a preferred text editor, [Atom](http://atom.io), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com), and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) are popular among Chef users, and run in a graphical user environment.
