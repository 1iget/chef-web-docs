In this lesson, you set up two of the three parts of a typical Chef setup. You installed the ChefDK and the Starter Kit on your workstation and set up your <%= t(:hosted_chef) %> account.

Chef server gives you a persistent location to store your cookbooks and information about your servers. The `knife` command enables you to communicate with the Chef server.

You also got a glimpse of the community cookbook site, [Chef Supermarket](<%= supermarket_url %>), and used it to retrieve a copy of our Learn Chef Apache cookbook. You then used `knife` to upload a copy of that cookbook to the Chef server.
