There are two ways to work with a Chef server.

1. Install an instance on your own infrastructure.
1. Sign up for <%= t(:hosted_chef) %> and let us host it for you.

Remember that your current goal is to manage a node remotely from your workstation. The fastest way to set up a Chef server is to use hosted Chef. It takes only a few moments and is free to get started.

[COMMENT] In production, the decision to use hosted Chef or manage your own Chef server depends on your organization's requirements and preferences. Although we recommend that you work with hosted Chef to get started, feel free to [compare the options](https://www.chef.io/chef/choose-your-version/). If you decide to set up Chef server on premises now, [the Chef documentation](https://docs.chef.io/server/install_server.html) and [this blog post](http://misheska.com/blog/2014/11/25/chef-server-12/) are great resources.
