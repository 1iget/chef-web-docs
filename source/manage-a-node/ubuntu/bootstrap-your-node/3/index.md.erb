Two things just happened.

First, your node was associated with your <%= t(:hosted_chef) %> account. To verify this, navigate to the [<%= t(:management_console) %>](<%= chef_manage_url %>/organizations). From the **Nodes** tab, you'll see an entry for the node you just bootstrapped.

You can also verify that the node successfully bootstrapped by running the `knife node list` command.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ knife node list
node1
```

You can use the `knife node show` command to view data about your node.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ knife node show node1
Node Name:   node1
Environment: _default
FQDN:
IP:          172.32.149.106
Run List:    recipe[learn_chef_apache2]
Roles:
Recipes:     learn_chef_apache2, learn_chef_apache2::default
Platform:    ubuntu 13.10
Tags:
```

The second thing that happened was that your node did an initial check in with the Chef server and ran the Apache cookbook. To verify this, open a web browser from your workstation and navigate to your web server.
