In [Learn the basics](/learn-the-basics/ubuntu/), you learned how to use Chef to bring up a web server and serve a basic home page. You configured the server by running the commands directly on it. Let's take a step towards how you use Chef in your production environment by configuring a second web server that you manage remotely from your workstation.

A typical Chef setup consists of three parts &ndash; your workstation, a Chef server, and nodes.

* Your __workstation__ is the computer from which you author your cookbooks and administer your network. It's typically the laptop or desktop computer you work from everyday. Although you're configuring an Ubuntu server, your workstation can be any OS you choose &ndash; be it Linux, Mac OS, or Windows.
* __Chef server__ acts as a central hub for your cookbooks.
* A __node__ is any computer that is managed by a Chef server. It can be any physical or virtual machine in your network.

In the lessons that follow, you'll work each part of this setup.
