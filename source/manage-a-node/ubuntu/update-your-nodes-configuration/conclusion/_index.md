That's it for this tutorial. You can continue to experiment with your virtual machine. When you're done, be sure to [clean up your environment](/manage-a-node/ubuntu/update-your-nodes-configuration#howtocleanupyourenvironment).

You can also explore the [Chef management console](https://manage.chef.io). See what info's available for your nodes and what else you can do.

In the next tutorial, [Develop your infrastructure code locally](/local-development/ubuntu/), you'll learn how _local development_ with Test Kitchen can help you iterate faster and correct mistakes earlier in the development process. With local development, you verify your cookbooks on local test instances that resemble production before you apply your work to a bootstrapped node.
