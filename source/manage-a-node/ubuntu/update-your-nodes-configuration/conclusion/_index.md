That's it for this tutorial. You can continue to experiment with your virtual machine. When you're done, be sure to [clean up your environment](/manage-a-node/ubuntu/update-your-nodes-configuration#howtocleanupyourenvironment).

You can also explore the [Chef management console](https://manage.chef.io). See what info's available for your nodes and what else you can do.

In the next tutorial, [Learn to manage a basic web application](/manage-a-web-app/ubuntu/), you'll use the skills you've just learned to build a basic but complete web application that uses a web server, a database, and scripting. You'll learn how to leverage cookbooks that are written by the Chef community and resolve cookbook dependencies to create cookbooks that are more reusable.
