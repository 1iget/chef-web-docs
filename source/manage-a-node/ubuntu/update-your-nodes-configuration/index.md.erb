[HEADLINE] You ran `knife bootstrap` to associate your node with the Chef server and do an initial check-in. Bootstrapping is a one-time process.<br>The `knife ssh` command enables you to update your node's configuration when your cookbook changes.

During the bootstrap process, your node downloaded and installed `chef-client`, downloaded the latest cookbooks, and executed the run-list.

Chef provides information about your node that you can access from your cookbooks. Let's update our home page to display some info about the node. You'll practice updating your cookbook, uploading it to the Chef server, and seeing the changes appear on your node.

You already learned [how to use the template resource](/learn-the-basics/ubuntu/make-your-recipe-more-manageable#step3) to reference the HTML file for your home page. You're ready to add placeholders to your HTML file that are filled in with info about your node as the recipe runs.
