We mentioned two ways.

1. Run `knife ssh` from your workstation.
1. SSH directly into your server and run `chef-client`.

You can also run `chef-client` as a [daemon, or service,](https://docs.chef.io/ctl_chef_client.html#run-as-a-service) to check in with the Chef server on a regular interval, say every 15 or 30 minutes.
