[HEADLINE] Any computer that's managed by Chef is called a _node_.

In [Learn the Chef basics](/learn-the-basics/rhel/), you installed the Chef DK on a server and configured it directly. Here you'll set up a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS server, called a _node_, and prepare your node to be configured by Chef remotely from your workstation.

Like before, we suggest that you work in a disposable environment such as a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS virtual machine. To ensure that the output you see matches the sample output that's shown, we recommend that you run Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 or CentOS 6.5 on your virtual machine. Also ensure that you have `sudo` or root access to the instance.

## 1. Get a Linux machine to bootstrap

We recommend that you set up a second virtual machine other than the one you used in the previous tutorial so that you can see the bootstrap process run on a clean configuration. However, you can also bootstrap the instance that you used in the previous tutorial &ndash; just keep in mind that the output you see won't match what's shown because that instance is already configured with the Chef tools and your basic Apache web server configuration.

If you don't have a preferred way to set up a server, here are some popular options.

AWS's [one-year free account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_US&sc_publisher=google&sc_medium=cloud_computing_b&sc_content=aws_free_e&sc_detail=aws%20free%20tier&sc_category=cloud_computing&sc_segment=73823473242&sc_matchtype=e&sc_country=US&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!73823473242!e!!g!!aws%20free%20tier&ef_id=VV3lAgAAAHK07c0y:20151119221840:s) gives you 750 hours per month of usage on the t2.micro tier.

If you're new to AWS, their [getting started guide](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/launch-a-virtual-machine/) walks you through the creation of your first Linux virtual machine.

When you're ready to continue with this tutorial, visit the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00IOYDTV6) to create a CentOS 6.5 instance. Select t2.micro to take advantage of the free usage tier. When you create your security group, ensure that ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS) are open for inbound network traffic.

Microsoft Azure is offering a [30-day free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) for up to $200 of usage.

When you're ready to continue with this tutorial, [follow this tutorial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-tutorial-portal-rm/) to create your Linux virtual machine. At the step where you choose the VM image, search for **CentOS-based 6.5**, published by OpenLogic. Also ensure that your VM enables inbound access on ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS).

<% accordion('vm-vagrant', 'VirtualBox and Vagrant') do %>

<% markdown do %>

[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) are free virtualization tools that enable you to manage virtual machine instances on your workstation.

Choose this option if you don't have access to cloud resources or you prefer to work with local virtual machines. You'll also need reasonably powerful hardware. Ensure that:

* your workstation supports and is configured to use CPU virtualization. This setting is typically configured through your system's BIOS.
* your workstation meets the [system requirements](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/End-user_documentation) requirements for running VirtualBox.
* your workstation has at least 5GB of free disk space. This will enable you to download the base image and run a few virtual machine instances.
* your workstation has at least 512MB memory available per virtual machine instance.
* nested virtualization is enabled if you're using another virtual machine as your workstation through a program such as VMWare Fusion.

Here's how to install VirtualBox and Vagrant and bring up a CentOS 6.5 instance.

Start by installing Virtual Box and Vagrant.

## 2. Gather some details about your machine

[COMMENT] All you need is for your virtual machine to be running &ndash; don't connect to it just yet.

Now, gather this information about your machine:

* Its host name or public IP address.
* A user name that has root or `sudo` access and its password. If you use key-based authentication to connect to your instance, note the location of your private key file.

<% markdown do %>

If you're bootstrapping a local virtual machine, such as a Vagrant instance, you'll also need to know which [forwarded port](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/forwarded_ports.html) Vagrant chose for routing SSH traffic. Forwarded ports enable the host (your workstation) to receive and forward network traffic to the guest (the virtual machine.)

If you're using virtualization software other than Vagrant and VirtualBox, check the documentation for that software to learn how to get the SSH connection details to the virtual machine, including the SSH forwarded port. Here's how to get the connection details for Vagrant.

## 3. Create a test SSH connection to your node

The bootstrap process connects to your node over SSH. Now that you have the connection details, let's create a test SSH connection to your node.

You don't have to do this every time you bootstrap a node, but verifying that your node is connectable will help ensure that the bootstrap process succeeds.

[WINDOWS] If you're on a Windows workstation and have Git installed, you can use the `ssh` command that we show here. If you're using PuTTY, the [getting started](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.66/htmldoc/Chapter2.html#gs) guide shows how to start an SSH connection. Also, if you're using key-based authentication, you'll need to [convert your private key](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.64/htmldoc/Chapter8.html#pubkey) to a format PuTTY can use.

Here are examples for the various ways you can connect.

### Connect using a username and password

```bash
$ ssh root@40.76.28.32
The authenticity of host '40.76.28.32 (40.76.28.32)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:YiT1n9QZ64GnXcCeRpYMOLxpJZ9IjCft1Fpf5tvAFuQ.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '40.76.28.32' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
root@40.76.28.32's password:
[root@40.76.28.32 ~]$ exit
logout
Connection to 40.76.28.32 closed.
```

### Connect using key-based authentication

```bash
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/my.pem root@40.76.28.32
The authenticity of host '40.76.28.32 (40.76.28.32)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:YiT1n9QZ64GnXcCeRpYMOLxpJZ9IjCft1Fpf5tvAFuQ.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '40.76.28.32' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
[root@40.76.28.32 ~]$ exit
logout
Connection to 40.76.28.32 closed.
```

### Connect to a local virtual machine using a forwarded port

Here's an example for Vagrant. The `-l` option specifies the username `vagrant`. The `-p` option specifies the port on the host (2222) that will forward to port 22 on the guest.

```bash
$ ssh -i /home/user/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key -l vagrant -p 2222 localhost
The authenticity of host '[localhost]:2222 ([127.0.0.1]:2222)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is c4:4d:f9:05:09:31:33:05:cd:99:52:5b:fc:e0:10:b5.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[localhost]:2222' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
Last login: Thu Dec  3 15:32:08 2015 from 10.0.2.2
[vagrant@localhost ~]$ exit
logout
Connection to localhost closed.
```

## Summary

In this lesson, you brought up a node that you'll later configure using Chef.

You also created a test connection to your node over SSH. But once you get the hang of things, you'll see that the bootstrap process enables you to configure your servers without the need to connect to them directly. This enables you to further automate the process of provisioning and configuring your infrastructure.
