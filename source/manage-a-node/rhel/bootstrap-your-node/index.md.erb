[HEADLINE] We call the process that installs `chef-client` on a node and the initial checkin to the Chef server _bootstrapping_ the node.

Recall that any computer that's managed by a Chef server is called a _node_, and that `chef-client` is the command that applies the policy defined by your cookbooks to a node.

Let's bootstrap a node and execute the Apache cookbook on it.

[START_BOX]

## 1. Bootstrap your node

Now that you've verified that you can connect to your node over SSH, you're now ready to bootstrap it.

First, make sure you're in the <code class="file-path">~/learn-chef</code> directory.

```bash
$ cd ~/learn-chef
```

Now choose the option that matches how you normally connect to your node over SSH.

[COMMENT] The optional `--node-name` argument uniquely identifies the node with the Chef server. Its value can be whatever you want. The server's FQDN is the default. If you previously used the name `node1` to bootstrap a different node, you'll need to choose a different name or [remove the previous node](/manage-a-node/rhel/update-your-nodes-configuration#howtocleanupyourenvironment).

### Bootstrap using a username and password

Replace <code class="placeholder">ADDRESS</code> with your remote node's external address, <code class="placeholder">USER</code> with your username, and <code class="placeholder">PASSWORD</code> with your user's password.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ knife bootstrap ADDRESS --ssh-user USER --ssh-password 'PASSWORD' --sudo --use-sudo-password --node-name node1 --run-list 'recipe[learn_chef_httpd]'

### Bootstrap a local virtual machine using a forwarded port

Here's an example for Vagrant.

Replace <code class="placeholder">PORT</code> with your SSH forwarded port, for example, 2222, and <code class="placeholder">IDENTITY\_FILE</code> with your SSH identify file, for example <code class="file-path">/home/user/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key</code>.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ knife bootstrap localhost --ssh-port PORT --ssh-user vagrant --sudo --identity-file IDENTITY_FILE --node-name node1 --run-list 'recipe[learn_chef_httpd]'

## If the operation times out or fails, here are some things to try

* Ensure that you run `knife` commands from your <code class="file-path">learn-chef</code> directory or one of its sub-directories.
* Ensure you have a <code class="file-path">learn-chef/.chef</code> directory and that it contains a <code class="file-path">knife.rb</code> file and your RSA private key file. If you don't, <a href="/manage-a-node/rhel/set-up-your-chef-server#step2" target="_blank">configure your workstation to communicate with Chef server</a>.
* Ensure that your node's IP address is accessible from your network.
* Ensure the user name you provide has root or `sudo` access on the node.
* Ensure your workstation has outbound access (including firewall) on these ports:
  * 22 (SSH)
  * 80 (HTTP)
  * 443 (HTTPS)
* Ensure your node has inbound access (including firewall) on these ports:
  * 22 (SSH)
* Ensure your node has outbound access (including firewall) on these ports:
  * 443 (HTTPS)

## 2. Confirm the result

Two things just happened.

First, your node was associated with your hosted Chef account. To verify this, navigate to the [https://manage.chef.io](https://manage.chef.io). From the **Nodes** tab, you'll see an entry for the node you just bootstrapped.

![The bootstrapped node](rhel/management-console-node.png)

You can also verify that the node successfully bootstrapped by running the `knife node list` command.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ knife node list
node1
```

You can use the `knife node show` command to view data about your node.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ knife node show node1
Node Name:   node1
Environment: _default
FQDN:        localhost
IP:          10.0.2.15
Run List:    recipe[learn_chef_httpd]
Roles:
Recipes:     learn_chef_httpd, learn_chef_httpd::default
Platform:    centos 7.2.1511
Tags:
```

The second thing that happened was that your node did an initial checkin with the Chef server and ran the Apache cookbook. To verify this, open a web browser from your workstation and navigate to your web server.

![The basic home page](misc/webserver-basic-remote.png)

If you bootstrapped a Vagrant instance, the easiest way to verify the configuration is to create an SSH connection to the instance and run `curl localhost`.

```bash
$ vagrant ssh
Last login: Thu Dec  3 17:17:26 2015 from 10.0.2.2
[vagrant@localhost ~]$ curl localhost
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>hello world</h1>
  </body>
</html>
[vagrant@localhost ~]$ exit
logout
Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.
```

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## Summary

The `knife bootstrap` command established an SSH connection to the node, installed `chef-client`, downloaded the Learn Chef Apache cookbook on the node, and ran it. In one command, Chef carried out most of the steps you previously performed manually.
