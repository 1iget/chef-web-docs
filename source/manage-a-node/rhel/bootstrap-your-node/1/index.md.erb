In [Learn the basics](/learn-the-basics/rhel/), you installed the ChefDK on a server and configured it directly. Now you need a machine that doesn't have the Chef tools on it so you can see how the bootstrap process works.

Like before, we suggest that you work in a disposable environment such as a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS virtual machine.

You can use your own machine if it meets the [system requirements](<%= chef_docs_url %>/chef_system_requirements.html#chef-client) and if you have root or `sudo` access to it.

Or, let us provide a CentOS virtual machine for you. Just click the button below.

<%= partial 'layouts/provisioner', locals: { title: 'CentOS', type: 'rhel-fundamentals' } %>

Now, gather this information about your machine:

* Its host name or public IP address.
* A user name and password you can log on with.

If you're using the virtual machine that we provide, click **More details** to get this info.

Write down the **External Address** for the VM and click **show password** to display the user's password.

![show password](/assets/images/quickstart/nodes/cloud-share/centos-show-password.png)

Write down the **Username** and **Password** that are displayed.

[COMMENT] All you need is for your virtual machine to be running &ndash; don't connect to it just yet.
