In [Learn the Chef basics](/learn-the-basics/rhel/), you learned how to use Chef to bring up a web server and serve a basic home page. You configured the server by running the commands directly on it. Now, let's simulate a production environment more closely by using Chef to configure another web server that you manage remotely, from your workstation.

Typically, Chef is comprised of three elements &ndash; your workstation, a Chef server, and nodes.

* Your __workstation__ is the computer from which you author your cookbooks and administer your network. It's typically the machine you use everyday. Although you'll be configuring a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server, your workstation can be any OS you choose &ndash; be it Linux, Mac OS, or Windows.
* __Chef server__ acts as a central repository for your cookbooks as well as for information about every node it manages. For example, the Chef server knows a node's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and its platform.
* A __node__ is any computer that is managed by a Chef server. Every node has the Chef client installed on it. The Chef client talks to the Chef server. A node can be any physical or virtual machine in your network.

In the lessons that follow, you'll use each of these three elements.
