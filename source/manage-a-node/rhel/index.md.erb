In [Learn the Chef basics](/learn-the-basics/rhel/), you learned how to use Chef to bring up a web server and serve a basic home page. You configured the server by running the commands directly on it. Now, let's simulate a production environment more closely by using Chef to configure another web server that you manage remotely, from your workstation.

Typically, Chef is comprised of three elements &ndash; your workstation, a Chef server, and nodes.

* Your __workstation__ is the computer from which you author your cookbooks and administer your network. It's typically the machine you use everyday. Although you'll be configuring a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server, your workstation can be any OS you choose &ndash; be it Linux, Mac OS, or Windows.
* __Chef server__ acts as a central repository for your cookbooks as well as for information about every node it manages. For example, the Chef server knows a node's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and its platform.
* A __node__ is any computer that is managed by a Chef server. Every node has the Chef client installed on it. The Chef client talks to the Chef server. A node can be any physical or virtual machine in your network.

In the lessons that follow, you'll use each of these three elements.

After completing this lesson, you'll:

* be able to write Chef code to define a policy from your workstation.
* be able to apply that policy to a node.
* understand how to access cookbooks written by the Chef community.

**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;To successfully complete this tutorial, you'll need two systems:

* A system running Linux, Mac OS, or Windows to act as your workstation. You can use a virtual machine or cloud instance if you don't want to use your primary computer.
* One system running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 or CentOS 6.5 to act as your node. This system can use spare hardware or run as a virtual machine or cloud instance.

The lessons that follow explain everything you'll need to get set up.
