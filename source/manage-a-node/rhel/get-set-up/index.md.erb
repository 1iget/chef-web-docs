Recall that your workstation is the computer from which you author your cookbooks and administer your network. Although you're configuring a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server, your workstation can be any OS you choose &ndash; be it Linux, Mac OS, or Windows.

[WINDOWS] If you're using a Windows 7 workstation, [you'll need to install Windows PowerShell 4.0](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/21016.how-to-install-windows-powershell-4-0.aspx) or later before you begin. PowerShell is part of the Windows Management Framework.
