## 3. Create a working directory

Create a directory to hold your work as you progress through the Learn Chef tutorials. Chef users commonly create a directory for their organization and a subdirectory for each project, as is common when working with GitHub.

For the Learn Chef tutorials, we'll use <code class="file-path">~/learn-chef</code> as the root directory.

```bash
# ~
$ mkdir ~/learn-chef
$ cd ~/learn-chef
```

You can use a different directory if you'd like &ndash; just be sure to adjust the paths you see in the tutorials.

[WINDOWS] On Windows, we recommend that you use PowerShell to work with Chef. On Learn Chef, we use the <code class="file-path">~</code> character in directory names, which is a common shortcut for the user's home directory on Linux, but also works in PowerShell. On Windows, <code class="file-path">~</code> refers to your home directory, for example, <code class="file-path">C:\Users\Administrator</code>.
