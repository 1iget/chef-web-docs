## 1. Install the Chef Development Kit

In the first tutorial, [Learn the Chef basics](/learn-the-basics/rhel/), you used the tools provided by the Chef Development Kit (Chef DK) to configure a virtual machine directly. Now it's time to install the Chef DK on your workstation so that you can manage a node remotely.

[COMMENT] You can also use a virtual machine as your workstation. Just make sure your VM meets the [system requirements](https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html#review-prerequisites).

[COMMENT] The [Chef documentation](https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html) describes additional steps that can help you set up your workstation to use Chef more effectively. You don't have to perform all the steps now, but you can refer to it later if you run into problems. For example, if you're running multiple versions of Ruby, the documentation explains [how to use Chef's Ruby](https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html#set-system-ruby).
