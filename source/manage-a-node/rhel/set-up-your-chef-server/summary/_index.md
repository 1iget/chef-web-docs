## Summary

At this point, you have two of the three elements of a typical Chef setup. You installed the Chef DK on your workstation and have access to the Chef server.

Chef server gives you a persistent location to store your cookbooks and information about your nodes. The `knife` command enables you to communicate with the Chef server.

You also got a glimpse of the community cookbook site, [Chef Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io), and used it to retrieve a copy of our Learn Chef Apache cookbook. You then used `knife` to upload a copy of that cookbook to the Chef server.
