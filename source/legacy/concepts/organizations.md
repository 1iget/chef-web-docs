An _organization_ is the top-level entity for role-based access control in Enterprise Chef. Each organization is a completely isolated tenant that shares nothing with other organizations. Oftentimes, organizations will represent different companies, business units or departments. For more information on organizations, see [Organizations, Groups, and Users](<%= chef_docs_url %>/server_orgs.html).
