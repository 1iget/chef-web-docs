## Configure IIS on Windows Server

Here you'll set up and validate IIS on Windows Server in 7 steps.

### Step 1: Create the cookbook

The [knife](<%= chef_docs_url %>/knife.html) command provides an interface between your workstation and the Chef server.
From your **chef-repo** directory, run the **knife** command to create a new cookbook.

```bash
# C:\chef_repo
$ knife cookbook create iis-tutorial-1
output output output
```

At this point, everything is set up locally, and nothing's sent to the Chef server. You'll upload the cookbook in a later step.

### Step 2: Write the recipe

When you create a cookbook, Chef creates a default recipe for you. From your text editor, open up the default recipe in the **iis-tutorial-1** cookbook.

```
cookbooks/iis-tutorial-1/recipes/default.rb
```

Now let's write some Ruby code to perform these actions:

  * install IIS
  * start the World Wide Web Publishing Service
  * configure the home page

Here's the code you need to add to default.rb:

```ruby
# default.rb
powershell_script 'Install IIS' do
  action :run
  code 'add-windowsfeature Web-Server'
end

service 'w3svc' do
  action [ :enable, :start ]
end

cookbook_file 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot\Default.htm' do
  source 'Default.htm'
  rights :read, 'Everyone'
end
```

### Step 3: Add a file resource

The final part of the recipe you just wrote uses the [cookbook_file](<%= chef_docs_url %>/resource_cookbook_file.html) resource to copy the home page. Now you need to add that resource to your cookbook.

Open Default.htm in your text editor and write out the homepage like this:

```html
# cookbooks/iis-tutorial-1/files/default/Default.htm
<html>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 4: Upload the cookbook to the Chef server

From the chef-repo directory, run **knife**'s [cookbook upload](<%= chef_docs_url %>/knife_cookbook.html#upload) command to upload your cookbook.

```bash
# C:\chef-repo
$ knife cookbook upload iis-tutorial-1
```

A copy of your cookbook is now on the Chef server.

### Step 5: Create the run list

The [run list](/concepts/run-lists/) defines the order in which recipes are run. In this tutorial, you have just one recipe in your run list.

To configure the run list for your Windows Server node, first navigate to [<%= chef_manage_url %>](<%= chef_manage_url %>) and log in to your Chef account. Then from the **Nodes** tab, select your node and open its run list.

Now drag the recipe from the **Available Recipes** box to the **Current Run List** box. Then click **Save Run List**.

### Step 6: Run chef-client

Next you'll run [chef-client](<%= chef_docs_url %>/essentials_chef_client.html) to get the latest cookbooks from the Chef server and bring your target node to its expected state.

The easiest way to run **chef-client** is to run the **knife** command from your local workstation. (Recall that you ran the **knife** command when you [bootstrapped](/get-started#bootstraptheimage) your node and that **knife** serves as the interface between you and the Chef server.)

Here's the command.

```bash
# C:\chef_repo
$ knife winrm ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com chef-client -m -x chef -P chef
```

Replace **ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com** with your node's IP address or hostname. If you're not using a Chef EC2 image, replace the **-x** and **-P** arguments with the username and password for an account that has Administrator access.

[INFO] Alternatively, you can log into your Windows Server node through Remote Desktop and run the **chef-client** command from PowerShell or the command prompt. Just be sure to open your prompt as Administrator.

As **chef-client** runs, you'll see Windows Server configure itself to run IIS and copy your basic web page to **c:\inetpub\wwwroot**.

### Step 7: Verify your home page

After the **chef-client** run completes, open a web browser from any computer and navigate to your test node. For example, if you're running on EC2, the URL might resemble:

```
http://ec2-xx-xx-xx-x.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

You'll see "Hello, world!" in your browser.

You did it! Now try the [Linux](#configureapacheonlinux) version of this tutorial, or jump to the [bottom](#whatnext) for next steps.
