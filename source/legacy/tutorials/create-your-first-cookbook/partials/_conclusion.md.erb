## What next?

Congratulations, you've successfully used Chef to configure your web server validated that it can serve up a basic web page. You now have a cookbook and a recipe that you can extend further or use as a template for something else. You also know how to run **chef-client** to update your configuration when things change. And you can do it all on Windows Server or Linux.

If you want to learn more about cookbooks, see the [Chef documentation for cookbooks](<%= chef_docs_url %>/essentials_cookbooks.html) on docs.opscode.com.

In the next tutorial, you'll learn a bit more about what happens during a **chef-client** run and then revise your Linux cookbook to run on multiple distros.
