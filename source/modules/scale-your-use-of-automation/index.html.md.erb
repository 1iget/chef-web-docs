In this webinar, we discuss how Chef Automate unifies:

- [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) for infrastructure automation,
- [InSpec](https://www.inspec.io) for compliance automation, and
- [Habitat](https://www.habitat.sh/) for application automation

into a comprehensive automation strategy for any company in today's digital world.

You'll learn how:

- workflow features provide a common pipeline for governance and dependency management.
- visibility features give you deep insight into whatâ€™s happening in your organization, including serverless `chef-client` runs and data from multiple Chef servers.
- compliance features enable automated compliance assessments in your workflow pipelines.
