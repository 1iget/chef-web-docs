A Chef _resource_ represents a piece of the system and its desired state. You're likely already familiar with the many [built-in resource types](https://docs.chef.io/resources.html) that Chef provides, such as [file](https://docs.chef.io/resource_file.html), [package](https://docs.chef.io/resource_package.html), and [service](https://docs.chef.io/resource_service.html).

Say you need to configure a web or database server. You could build your configuration from the built-in resource types. If you need to configure multiple, but similar, systems, you'll find that you often need to repeat many of the details.

To make your recipes more concise and easier to manage, you can create a _custom resource type_. A custom resource type combines existing built-in resources, and can even include other custom resources.

In this webinar, we explain what a custom resource is, why you might want to write one, introduce you to the language concepts, and walk you through how to make your own.
