When first getting started with Chef, you may have a Chef server running on a VM, cloud instance, or spare hardware that you use to learn how Chef works or to create a proof of concept. Typically, security isn't a main concern because your setup acts on test infrastructure that's not connected to your production environment.

As you prepare to deploy Chef to your production environment, securing your installation should be a key part of your planning.

In the article and webinars that follow, you'll learn:

* How to develop a secure workflow, including securing access to the Chef server, securing the Chef client, and securing your workstation.
* How to protect sensitive data using a variety of techniques, including encrypted data bags, [Chef Vault](https://github.com/chef/chef-vault), and HashiCorp's [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io).
