Chef Compliance enables you to express your compliance rules as code. You can easily run those rules as tests whenever you want. You get immediate feedback on whether your servers are configured as they should be.

Chef Compliance scans your servers to see if they are configured in accordance with your rules and generates a report that identifies the issues it found. You can then use Chef to remediate those problems.

In this webinar, Joe Gardiner demonstrates how Chef Compliance works by scanning a default installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 on the public cloud to see if it is compliant with the [Center for Internet Secuirty](https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org) (CIS) benchmarks. After the scan identifies potential problem areas, Joe uses Chef to bring the server in line with the CIS benchmarks.
