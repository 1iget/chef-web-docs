Systems running Windows PowerShell 5.0 can use [dsc_resource](https://docs.chef.io/resource_dsc_resource.html) to define DSC resources.

Here's what the `dsc_script` resource you just wrote might look like using `dsc_resource`.

```ruby
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/awesome_customers_windows/recipes/web.rb
dsc_resource 'Web-Asp-Net45' do
  resource :windowsfeature
  property :name, 'Web-Asp-Net45'
  property :ensure, 'Present'
end
```

`dsc_resource` resources more closely resemble other Chef resources and don't require use of here documents, so they can be written using less code.

[WARN] Windows PowerShell 5.0 and `dsc_resource` are still under development. Refer to the [dsc_resource documentation](https://docs.chef.io/resource_dsc_resource.html) for more information on its status and restrictions.
