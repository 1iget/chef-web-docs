You typically don't need to clear the Chef cache, but suppose that the Chef cache contains large files or files that contain sensitive data (such as passwords or personally identifiable information) that you need to remove.

To delete the SQL script, use the `file` resource. Make sure you delete the file after the database is completely initialized, like this (lines 16&mdash;19.)

```ruby
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/awesome_customers_windows/recipes/database.rb
# [...]

# Run the SQL file only if the 'learnchef' database has not yet been created.
powershell_script 'Initialize database' do
  code <<-EOH
    Import-Module "#{sqlps_module_path}"
    Invoke-Sqlcmd -InputFile #{create_database_script_path}
  EOH
  guard_interpreter :powershell_script
  only_if <<-EOH
    Import-Module "#{sqlps_module_path}"
    (Invoke-Sqlcmd -Query "SELECT COUNT(*) AS Count FROM sys.databases WHERE name = 'learnchef'").Count -eq 0
  EOH
end

# Delete the SQL file.
file create_database_script_path do
  action :delete
end

# [...]
```
