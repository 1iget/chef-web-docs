This module builds on the [Get started with Test Kitchen](/modules/local-development/) module, and has the same requirements. We recommend you work through that module before starting this one.

<%= link_to("Get started with Test Kitchen <i class='fa fa-angle-double-right'></i>", "/modules/local-development/", class: 'button radius cta cta') %>

When you choose your platform, select either the CentOS or Ubuntu option. On the page that follows, if you choose an option other than Vagrant and VirtualBox, you can adapt the Test Kitchen configuration shown in this module to your preferred Test Kitchen driver.

[COMMENT] Remember, although you're configuring an Ubuntu server, your workstation can be any OS you choose &ndash; be it Windows, macOS, or some other flavor of Linux. Your workstation can also be a virtual machine that's running on VMware Fusion or another hypervisor that enables nested virtualization.

At this point, your workstation should:

* have the latest version of the Chef DK.
* have a programmer's text editor that you're comfortable working with.
* have the <% fp('~/learn-chef') %> directory for you to work in.
* have an SSH client &ndash; if you're running Windows, the Chef DK provides an SSH client.

Having an SSH client is important because you'll use it to verify your work.

You should also be familiar with the basics of Test Kitchen, such as how to create, converge, and destroy instances.
