This tutorial builds on what you learned in [Get started with Test Kitchen](/modules/local-development/ubuntu/).

This tutorial uses the Vagrant Test Kitchen driver, which uses Vagrant and VirtualBox. If you went through _Get started with Test Kitchen_ using a different driver, you can change what you see here.

If you're new to Test Kitchen, the pages that follow will point you to what you need to get set up.
