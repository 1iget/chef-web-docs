## 2. Prepare a text editor

Because Chef uses _code_ to express infrastructure policy, it's important that you use a text editor that provides features such as syntax highlighting and line numbering.

After you launch your Ubuntu server, open a command prompt and bring up a text editor. The virtual machine comes with `emacs`, `nano`, and `vim` pre-installed. If you prefer another text editor, install it now.

If you're new to using command-line text editors on Ubuntu, here are some resources to help get you started.

Now that you have your virtual machine with the Chef DK and a text editor set up, let's use Chef to configure a file, a kind of _resource_, on it.
