[Equifax Inc.](http://www.equifax.com/about-equifax/) is a global leader in consumer, commercial and workforce information solutions that provide businesses of all sizes and consumers with insights and information they can trust. Equifax organizes and assimilates data on more than 820 million consumers and 91 million businesses worldwide.

In this article, we feature Jim Grill, Senior Director of IT Software Engineering and Automation at Equifax about how the company is using [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) in conjunction with the compliance feature that is a part of [Chef Automate](https://www.chef.io/automate/). InSpec is Chef's open-source, human-readable language for automating the continuous testing and compliance auditing of your entire infrastructure. The Chef Automate compliance feature creates customizable reports that identify compliance issues, security risks, and outdated software.

##The challenge
Equifax has been using Chef server since April 2014. They began experimenting with InSpec when it was first released and fully adopted it in August 2015. They also recently started to use Chef Automate. Equifax bases its compliance standards on DISA STIGs (Defense Information Security Agency Security Technical Information Guides) from NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology).

DISA STIGs are not open source and are written in XML, which makes them extremely difficult to read and understand. In order to turn their compliance requirements into code, Jim's team had to translate the benchmarks into InSpec. "We had to go through and painstakingly piece these things together, which took a very long time," he explains. "However, given our other options, and the fact that there's no SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) import tool, this was our best choice."

##The benefits of automated compliance
The effort paid off. Using InSpec along with Chef has proven to be a very effective way of ensuring that Equifax infrastructure is secure and in compliance with company standards. "InSpec is great because it's already integrated with Chef, and we're already using Chef to do our hardening for us," Jim says. In the old days, you'd build these so-called golden images and as soon as you deployed them, it was just a countdown to configuration drift and obsolescence. Now, we can maintain our security policies with Chef.  Chef is actually scanning and checking to make sure everything's in compliance."


One advantage for companies that already use Chef is that there's no need to add another agent onto each server for compliance checking. Jim explains the implications. "Chef's already there, everywhere," he says. "Being able to reuse an agent is a big deal. In the enterprise world, there are agents for everything. We have agents collecting logs, we have agents for asset management, we have agents to check software licensing, we have agents that security wants on the system. We've just got a ton of them. It's true that now, with more CPU and more memory, it's not as big of a deal but still, when you start counting 9 or 10 agents running on a system, it's very easy to want to try and figure out how you can reduce that number, so having it built in with Chef is fantastic."

##The benefits of using InSpec with Chef Automate
The fact that InSpec, in contrast to other compliance solutions, is easy to read and use is particularly compelling. The graphical reports that Chef Automate generates are an added bonus. "Now we have something we can show people, and I think that's the important part, if people want to see a sampling," he adds. "We get audits, a lot of companies do, that are subject to compliance and you can show somebody a report and, right away, they just skip a whole bunch of stuff and say, 'Okay, that's great. You have that for all services. We're just moving on.' You save yourself a bunch of evidence collection and trying to explain where your hardening standards comes from.

"Also, because InSpec is so easy to understand, it's easy for auditors to look at the InSpec source and understand what you're checking for," he continues. "The InSpec language itself, I think, is phenomenal. You can't do that with SCAP content. It's just a bunch of XML, and it's impossible to read through it. It's hard to understand how it even works. Something in almost plain English is fantastic.

"When you use something off the shelf like CIS or DISA STIGs and you have a tool that proves you're in compliance with your own standard, you're winning at that point."
