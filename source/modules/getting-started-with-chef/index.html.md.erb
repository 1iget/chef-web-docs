Welcome! If you’re new to Chef, this article is for you. We’ll cover briefly what Chef is and explain how to create a learning path that's tailored to your role and interests.

## What is Chef?

Chef helps you automate how infrastructure is configured, deployed, and managed across your network.

Chef offers a commercial product called [Chef Automate](https://www.chef.io/automate/), which builds upon three open-source projects: [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/), [InSpec](https://www.chef.io/inspec/), and [Habitat](https://www.habitat.sh/).

**Chef** is our foundational open source project. Chef enables you to manage your infrastructure by expressing your configuration requirements as _code_. The benefit of code is that it helps make your configuration policies more flexible, versionable, human-readable, and testable. Chef works in cloud, on-premises, or hybrid environments. Chef supports both Windows and many flavors of Linux and Unix.

**InSpec** is a human-readable language for specifying compliance, security and other policy requirements. InSpec helps you move fast by ensuring your changes meet your security and compliance needs before and after you deploy infrastructure changes.

**Habitat** is a framework that centers application configuration, management, and behavior around the application itself, not the infrastructure that the app runs on. You can deploy Habitat packages to various infrastructure environments, such as bare metal, VMs, containers, and PaaS.

**Chef Automate** enables multiple teams to work together to deploy software. With Chef Automate, you can integrate security and policy testing into the Chef Automate pipeline and have visibility into everything that's happening to your infrastructure.

For a more technical overview of Chef, [visit the Chef documentation](https://docs.chef.io/chef_overview.html).

## How Learn Chef Rally works

Learn Chef Rally is the hub of Chef and DevOps related resources for building your skills.

The curriculum is organized through _tracks_. A track groups related learning activities. Here's an example from the homepage.

We call each learning activity a _module_. Modules include a mix of hands-on labs, articles, and videos. Our hands-on labs help you get started quickly on the platform and in the environment and you care about most.

As you work through each module, you'll have the opportunity to answer a few quiz questions to check your understanding. Answering these questions correctly gives you credit for having completed the module. You can track your progress on the home page.

We'll mark a track as complete when you finish each module.

When you're ready, you can sign up for a Learn Chef Rally account. An account enables you to:

* track your progress from any device.
* subscribe to updates to stay informed when new content is available.
* share your progress with others.

## Getting started

What you do first really depends on what you want. Are you more interested in the business value of DevOps and automation? Do you want to get hands-on with the technology as quickly as possible? Are you already familiar with Chef and want to broaden your skills?

Find a track that fits your role and interests. Not sure where to start? The [Infrastructure Automation](/tracks/infrastructure-automation/) track is definitely the starting point for most people who want a hands-on approach.

You can also [select individual modules](/modules/) to create a customized learning path.

If you're interested in the Habitat project, visit [www.habitat.sh](https://www.habitat.sh).

## Need help?

As your work through the labs, if you get stuck on a particular step, ask in the discussion forum that appears at the bottom of the page.

Chef's support team and the community are also here to help. For general questions and issues, [Discourse](https://discourse.chef.io) and the [Chef Community Slack team](http://community-slack.chef.io/) are the fastest ways to get help from the community. [Check out our support page](https://www.chef.io/support/) for additional options or [open a ticket with our support team](https://www.chef.io/support/tickets/).

## Other resources

Chef has a complete set of [reference docs](https://docs.chef.io). For example, if you're writing a cookbook and need to learn about a particular resource, you'll find it here. Chef docs also include conceptual overviews of each of our products.

If you want a more personal approach, Chef offers [training classes](https://training.chef.io/) led by a team of experienced instructors. You can attend in person or join one of our live online sessions. We also have a certification program that offers different levels of accreditation.

The Chef [community page](/community/) is home to a diverse group of practitioners who are dedicated to helping others become successful with Chef and DevOps. From meet-ups to podcasts run and created by community members, there are multiple ways to engage, contribute, share, and learn from others.

In addition, Chef’s home page, [www.chef.io](https://www.chef.io), has links to helpful overview material as well as information about webinars, meet-ups, events and more.

Chef also offers professional services that can get you started fast and help with the planning and design of your Chef and Chef Automate installation.

If you want more guidance, feel free to talk to us. Use the "Contact Us" box at the bottom of [this page](https://www.chef.io). We’d be happy to answer your questions and get you connected to the resources you need.
