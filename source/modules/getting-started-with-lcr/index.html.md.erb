Welcome! If you’re new to Learn Chef Rally, this article is for you. Once you read it, you'll be ready to become an awesome Chef.

## What is Learn Chef Rally?

If you're new to Chef, just know that Chef lets you automate all the things&mdash;infrastructure, applications, compliance and more. Learn Chef Rally will teach you how. It's the hub for Chef and DevOps related resources that will build your skills.

The Learn Chef Rally curriculum is organized by _tracks_. A track groups related learning activities. Here's an example.

We call each learning activity a _module_. Modules include a mix of hands-on labs, articles, and videos. Our hands-on labs help you get started quickly on the platform that you care about most.

When you finish a module, you'll see a few quiz questions at the end. Answering these questions correctly gives you credit for having completed the module. You can track your progress on the home page.

We'll mark a track as complete when you finish every module.

When you're ready, you can sign up for a Learn Chef Rally account. An account enables you to:

* track your progress from any device.
* subscribe to updates so you'll know when new content is available.
* share your progress with others.

## Getting started

What you do first really depends on what you want. Are you more interested in the business value of DevOps and automation? Do you want to get hands-on with the technology as quickly as possible? Are you already familiar with Chef and want to broaden your skills?

Find a track that fits your role and interests. Not sure where to start? The [Infrastructure Automation](/tracks/infrastructure-automation/) track is definitely the starting point for most people who want a hands-on approach.

You can also [select individual modules](/modules/) to create a more customized learning path.

## Need help?

If you get stuck on a particular step in one of the labs, you can ask questions in the discussion forum that appears at the bottom of the page.

Chef's support team and the community are also here to help. For general questions and issues, [Discourse](https://discourse.chef.io) and the [Chef Community Slack team](http://community-slack.chef.io/) are the fastest ways to get help from the community. [Check out our support page](https://www.chef.io/support/) for additional options or [open a ticket with our support team](https://www.chef.io/support/tickets/).

## Other resources

Chef has a complete set of reference docs at [docs.chef.io](https://docs.chef.io). For example, if you're writing a cookbook and need to learn about a particular resource, you'll find it there. Chef docs also include conceptual overviews of each of our products.

If you want a more personal approach, Chef offers [training classes](https://training.chef.io/) led by a team of experienced instructors. You can attend in person or join one of our live online sessions. We also have a certification program that offers different levels of accreditation.

The Chef [community page](/community/) is home to a diverse group of practitioners who are dedicated to helping others become successful with Chef and DevOps.
