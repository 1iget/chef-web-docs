In this webinar, Franklin Webber shows you techniques that bring elegance to a cookbook’s tests. You’ll learn how to eliminate redundancy, rebuild common patterns into helpers, and extract those helpers into a portable library.

You'll see how to:

- Refactor tests for more elegant code.
- Craft reusable testing resources and helpers.
- Extract testing resources into a Ruby gem.
