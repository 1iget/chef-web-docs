In this webinar, Franklin Webber focuses on the power of unit tests. He shows where they fit within a test-driven approach to cookbook development and demonstrates how they can speed up that process. His tool of choice is ChefSpec. ChefSpec is a unit testing framework that allows you to write RSpec-style tests and itâ€™s included in the Chef DK. At the end of the session, you'll know how to use ChefSpec to write great unit tests, and where you can go to improve your skills even more.
