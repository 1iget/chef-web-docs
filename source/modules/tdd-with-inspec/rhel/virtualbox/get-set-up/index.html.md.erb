Here's what you'll need to complete this module.

If you've gone through the [Infrastructure Automation](/tracks/infrastructure-automation/) track and the [Get started with Test Kitchen](/modules/local-development/rhel/) module (using the Vagrant and VirtualBox option), then you're all set up.

## Understand hardware requirements

To successfully complete this module, you'll need a Windows, macOS, or Linux workstation that has relatively powerful hardware. We recommend that your workstation have at least 15GB of free disk space and at least 4GB of available memory so that you can download the base image and run a few virtual machine instances.

## Set up your workstation for local development

To complete this module, you'll need the following on your workstation:

* The latest version of the Chef Development Kit (Chef DK).
* A programmer's text editor.
* A directory to work in &ndash; here we use <% fp '~/learn-chef' %>.
* The virtualization software [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

This module also requires familiarity with local development using Test Kitchen.

If you need to set up your workstation with the Chef DK, a text editor, or your working directory, [follow these steps](/modules/manage-a-node-chef-server/rhel/hosted/set-up-your-workstation/).

If you don't have VirtualBox and Vagrant installed, or you aren't familiar with Test Kitchen, work through [Get started with Test Kitchen](/modules/local-development/rhel/virtualbox/) before you start this module. This module teaches you the basics of how to apply cookbooks on local test instances, all on your workstation.
