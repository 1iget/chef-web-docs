# Test driven development with InSpec

In this module, you'll learn how to use [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) to automatically verify a basic web server configuration. You'll run InSpec from Test Kitchen on a virtual machine running on your workstation.

## Choose your server environment

We provide content for CentOS, but you can apply the concepts to Windows and other Linux platforms.
