The solution depends on the compliance rule you choose and how you approach it.

Remember that remediation most commonly begins with local development. Make sure that your remediation succeeds on a test instance before you apply your changes to your node.

As a recommended step, you should always [update your cookbook's version metadata](/modules/create-a-web-app-cookbook/windows/updating-your-nodes-configuration#updateyourcookbook39sversionmetadata) to ensure that each version is tied to a specific set of functionality.

After you've verified your change on a local test instance, run the `knife cookbook upload` command to upload your cookbook to the Chef server.  

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ knife cookbook upload admpwd
Uploading admpwd            [0.2.0]
Uploaded 1 cookbook.
```

Then, [run chef-client on your node](/modules/create-a-web-app-cookbook/windows/updating-your-nodes-configuration#runchefclientonyournode) and repeat the compliance scan.
