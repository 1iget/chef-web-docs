# Choose your test environment

This tutorial builds on the previous, [Scan for compliance](/tutorials/compliance-assess/windows/). There, you brought up two systems &ndash; the Chef compliance scanner and a node to scan &ndash; in your environment. In this tutorial, you'll also bring up a Chef server.

In addition, you'll use Test Kitchen to bring up test environments to verify fixes to compliance failures _before_ you apply those fixes to your node. These test environments can include cloud providers such as Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine as well as non-cloud environments such as Hyper-V and VirtualBox.

Choose where you'll run your test instances.
