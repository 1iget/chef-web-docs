This module comes in two parts.

In the first part, [Remediate the compliance failure on a local virtual machine](/modules/compliance-remediate/ubuntu/virtualbox/remediate-the-compliance-failure-on-a-local-virtual-machine/), you'll replicate and remediate the failure of the **Ensure Firewall is active** rule on a local virtual machine.

In the second part, [Remediate the compliance failure on your node](/modules/compliance-remediate/ubuntu/virtualbox/remediate-the-compliance-failure-on-your-node/), you'll apply the remediation to your node and rerun the compliance scan to verify that the node's firewall configuration satisfies the **Ensure Firewall is active** rule.

Both parts use Chef and require a basic understanding of:

* Chef's _test and repair_ approach.
* working with a Chef server.
* local development using Test Kitchen.
* working with the Chef compliance scanner.

If you're new to Chef, we recommend that you first work through the _Infrastructure Automation_ track. You'll learn about Chef's test and repair approach, how Chef server works, and practice local development using Test Kitchen.

[START_BOX]

## Get started with the Chef compliance scanner

For this module, you'll need a Chef compliance scanner installation and an Ubuntu 14.04 node that leaves Ubuntu's default firewall, UFW, inactive.

Be sure to complete the previous module, [Scan for compliance](/modules/compliance-assess/ubuntu/), before starting this one.

[COMMENT] This module uses Chef server and Chef compliance scanner as standalone components. Although not required,  you can later [integrate Chef Complance with Chef server](https://docs.chef.io/integrate_compliance_chef_server.html) to enable Chef compliance scanner users to log in using their Chef server credentials and enable nodes to download Chef compliance scanner profiles, run them, and send the results back to Chef compliance scanner.
