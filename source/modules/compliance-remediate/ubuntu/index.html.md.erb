# Choose your test environment

This module builds on the previous, [Scan for compliance](/modules/compliance-assess/ubuntu/). There, you brought up two systems &ndash; the Chef compliance scanner and a node to scan &ndash; in your environment. In this module, you'll also bring up a Chef server.

In addition, you'll use Test Kitchen to bring up test environments to verify fixes to compliance failures _before_ you apply those fixes to your node. These test environments can include cloud providers such as Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine as well as non-cloud environments such as Hyper-V and VirtualBox.

We currently provide content for Vagrant and VirtualBox. You can apply the concepts to other test environments. If you're new to using Vagrant and VirtualBox with Test Kitchen, we'll point you to how to get set up.
