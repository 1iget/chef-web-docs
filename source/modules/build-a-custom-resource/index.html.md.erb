# Build a custom resource

In this module, you'll walk through the creation of a [custom Chef resource](https://docs.chef.io/custom_resources.html) that configures Apache web server on multiple Linux platforms. You'll get starter code from GitHub, see the custom resource in action, and run automated tests that verify the resource's behavior.

## Choose your server platform

We provide content for Linux, but you can equally apply the concepts to Windows.
