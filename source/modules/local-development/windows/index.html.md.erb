# Choose your test environment

Test Kitchen enables you to run your cookbooks in a number of [test environments](https://docs.chef.io/kitchen.html#drivers). These test environments include cloud providers such as Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine as well as non-cloud environments such as Hyper-V and VirtualBox.

Choose where you'll run your test instances.
