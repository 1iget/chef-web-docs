# Get started with Test Kitchen

In this module, you'll learn how [Test Kitchen](https://docs.chef.io/kitchen.html) helps speed up the development process by applying your infrastructure code on test environments from your workstation, _before_ you apply your work in production.

## Choose your server platform

Before you set up your workstation for local development, choose the server platform you want to manage. You'll likely want to continue with what you used for the [Learn the Chef basics](/modules/learn-the-basics) and [Manage a node with Chef server](/modules/manage-a-node) modules.

Click on one of the buttons below to select the kind of system you want to work with.
