| Tool           | Phase |
|---------------:|-------------|
| RuboCop | pre-convergence |
| Foodcritic | pre-convergence |
| ChefSpec | pre-convergence |
| Chef audit mode | convergence |
| Serverspec | post-convergence |
| Test Kitchen | convergence and post-convergence |

Remember,

* _Pre-convergence_ is the phase before a node is converged by Chef, and is the phase when testing that doesnâ€™t require a node to run Chef happens.
* _Convergence_ is the phase when Chef runs and makes changes to the system to converge it to be in the desired state.
* _Post-convergence_ is the phase after a node finishes running Chef. Testing in this phase verifies that the node is in the desired state.
