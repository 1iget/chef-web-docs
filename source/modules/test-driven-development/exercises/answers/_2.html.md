Running tests in the convergence or post-convergence phase requires a full `chef-client` run. Although testing during or after these phases can help you validate that the system was configured as you expect, testing during the pre-convergence phase, or before `chef-client` runs, can help you:

* ensure that your Chef code adheres to your style guide. When all contributors adhere to a consistent set of standards, code can be easier to read and maintain.
* speedup the feedback cycle. For example, consider this recipe that deletes a shell script:

```ruby
# default.rb
file '/tmp/sql-commands.sh' do
  action :delete
end
```

A ChefSpec test for this recipe might look like:

```ruby
# default_spec.rb
require 'chefspec'

describe 'file::delete' do
  let(:chef_run) { ChefSpec::Runner.new.converge(described_recipe) }

  it 'deletes the SQL commands script' do
    expect(chef_run).to delete_file('/tmp/sql-commands.sh')
  end
end
```

This ChefSpec test validates that the recipe  _would_ delete the file <code class="file-path">/tmp/sql-commands.sh</code> without actually performing the action.

The point of this test is not to test whether Chef itself works. Rather, it can help you prevent _regressions_, or unintended breaks in functionality that happen when features are added or changed.
