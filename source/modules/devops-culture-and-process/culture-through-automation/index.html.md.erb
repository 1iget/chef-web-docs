Many companies want to break down the silos that separate different teams in their organization but find that the lack of a common approach to automation presents a formidable challenge. At Chef, we had that very problem when we realized that, to effectively demo our then unreleased product Chef Automate, we needed to automate its installation.

In this webinar, we'll discuss what folks at Chef learned about bringing different groups together to create something that everyone can use. Theyâ€™ll talk about using tools besides Chef, leveraging test-driven development methods, and dogfooding through automation.
