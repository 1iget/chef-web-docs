As automation lightens the load on IT operations personnel, and the DevOps cultural shift brings dev and ops together, some ops people are worried about their jobs.

Furthermore, as DevOps takes hold, other roles in the organization are set to transform. DevOps potentially reworks project management methodologies, so what about the project managers? DevOps flattens organizations, so should middle managers be worried?

In this webinar, join Jason Bloomberg, industry analyst and president of Intellyx, and Pauly Comtois, VP of DevOps at Hearst Business Media, for a thought-provoking, in-depth discussion of how DevOps impacts individual's roles within the organization, with some first-person stories of Hearst Business Mediaâ€™s DevOps transformation.
