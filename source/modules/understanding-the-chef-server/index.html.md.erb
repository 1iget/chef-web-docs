This webinar is an overview of the Chef Server&mdash;how it’s designed, how it’s packaged, and general advice on operating it at scale (for example, monitoring and troubleshooting). We’ll talk about each of the Chef server components and how they fit together. Next, we’ll explain the Omnibus system, which lets you build native packages for different platforms. Finally, we’ll show you a few troubleshooting techniques.
