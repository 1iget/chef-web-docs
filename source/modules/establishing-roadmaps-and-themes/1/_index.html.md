## Define your roadmap

A roadmap can codify your thoughts about how best to discover what customers need and will love. To create a roadmap:

1. Start with your vision
1. Align your vision with customer feedback
1. Balance innovation with customer needs
1. Group the results of steps 1 through 3 into themes, and associate each theme with an outcome
1. Distill those themes into features and validate the features with your customers

For example, a theme on the Chef roadmap was ecosystem development, and its outcome was that companies other than Chef should sell Chef. Various people had ideas on how to achieve that outcome, and those ideas became the features. Next, a team validated those features with customers. If the features didn't resonate, then the team would come up with different features that could still fulfill the outcome. The team would then do another iteration with customers.
