# Manage a node with Chef Automate

The [Manage a node with Chef server](/modules/manage-a-node-chef-server) module introduces you to the Chef server. Chef Automate, which includes Chef server, provides a workflow-based approach to enable teams to deploy changes faster and with greater safety.

This module resembles _Manage a node with Chef server_, but highlights how Chef Automate's _visiblity_ feature provides insight into what's happening on your Chef server to better understand what happens when `chef-client` runs on your nodes. Later, you can use the Chef Automate system you set up here in our follow-up module, [Deploy infrastructure changes with Chef Automate](/modules/deploy-infrastructure/).

## Choose your server platform

Before you set up a Chef Automate, choose the server platform you want to manage. You'll likely want to continue with what you used for the [Learn the Chef basics](/modules/learn-the-basics/) module.

Click on one of the buttons below to select the kind of system you want to work with.
