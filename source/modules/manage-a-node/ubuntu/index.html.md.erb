# Choose your Chef server environment

For this tutorial you'll need a Chef server. Chef server acts as a central repository for your cookbooks as well as for information about every node it manages.

Choose where you want to manage your server. Hosted Chef and AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate are the fastest ways to get started.
