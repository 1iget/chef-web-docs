# Manage a node

Now that you've learned how cookbooks, recipes, and resources work, learn how the Chef server acts as a central repository for your cookbooks and for information about your servers, or _nodes_.

## Choose your server environment

Chef server runs on Linux. You'll acquire a Chef server either through our hosted service or by installing your own.

Before you set up a Chef server, choose the server platform you want to manage. You'll likely want to continue with what you used for the [Learn the Chef basics](/tutorials/learn-the-basics) tutorial.

Click on one of the buttons below to select the kind of system you want to work with.
