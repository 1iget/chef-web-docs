`knife` requires two files to communicate with the Chef server:

* an RSA private key
* a configuration file, <code class="file-path">knife.rb</code>

These files are typically located in a directory named <code class="file-path">.chef</code>. `knife` traverses up the directory tree to locate this directory.
