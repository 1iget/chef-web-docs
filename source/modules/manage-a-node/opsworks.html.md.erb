# Manage a node using AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate

[AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate](https://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/chefautomate/?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=ops-works-chef-automate-launch-2016&sc_publisher=chef&sc_country=global&sc_geo=global&sc_category=opsworks-chef-automate&sc_outcome=devadopt) enables you to run a Chef server and a Chef Automate server easily in AWS. OpsWorks handles their operations, backups, restorations, and software upgrades, freeing you from many configuration management tasks.

Before you set up OpsWorks for Chef Automate, choose the server platform you want to manage. If you've gone through the [Learn the Chef basics](/tutorials/learn-the-basics) tutorial, you'll likely want to continue with the platform you used there.

Click on one of the buttons below to select the kind of system you want to work with.
