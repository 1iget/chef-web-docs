[knife](https://docs.chef.io/knife.html) is the command-line tool that provides an interface between your workstation and the Chef server. `knife` enables you to upload your cookbooks to the Chef server and work with _nodes_, the servers that you manage.

`knife` requires two files to authenticate with the Chef server.

1. **an RSA private key**

  Every request to the Chef server is authenticated through an RSA public key pair. The Chef server holds the public part; you hold the private part.
1. **a `knife` configuration file**

  The configuration file is typically named <code class="file-path">knife.rb</code>. It contains information such as the Chef server's URL, the location of your RSA private key, and the default location of your cookbooks.

Both of these files are typically located in a directory named <code class="file-path">.chef</code>. By default, every time `knife` runs, it looks in the current working directory for the <code class="file-path">.chef</code> directory. If the <code class="file-path">.chef</code> directory does not exist, `knife` searches up the directory tree for a <code class="file-path">.chef</code> directory. This process is similar to how tools such as Git work.
