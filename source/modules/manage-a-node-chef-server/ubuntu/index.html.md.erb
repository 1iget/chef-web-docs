# Choose your Chef server environment

For this tutorial you'll need a Chef server. Chef server acts as a central repository for your cookbooks as well as for information about every node it manages.

[COMMENT] If you're new to Chef, we recommend that you stay on this path to learn how Chef server works. Later, you can [repeat this tutorial using Chef Automate](/modules/manage-a-node-chef-automate), a full-stack continuous automation platform which includes Chef server.

Choose where you want to manage your server.
