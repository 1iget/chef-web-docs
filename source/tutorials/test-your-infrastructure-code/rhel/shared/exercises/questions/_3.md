Write a cookbook based solely on the following InSpec test.

```ruby
# default_test.rb
describe package 'postfix' do
  it { should be_installed }
end

describe service 'postfix' do
  it { should be_enabled }
  it { should be_running }
end

describe file '/etc/postfix/main.cf' do
  its('content') { should match /^mydomain = example.com$/ }
  its('content') { should match /^myorigin = example.com$/ }
end
```

This question is more challenging, so it's OK if you need to follow along with the answer.

**Hint:** You can find a cookbook for the Postfix mail server on <a href="https://supermarket.chef.io/">Chef Supermarket</a>. Find the necessary node attributes and add them to your default attributes file or to the <code>attributes</code> section of your <code class="file-path">.kitchen.yml</code> file.
