Here you'll ensure your workstation is set up to develop Chef code locally. If you're new to local development, you'll also work through some of our previous tutorials to build your skills.

[START_BOX]

## 1. Understand hardware requirements

To successfully complete this tutorial, you'll need a Windows, MacOS, or Linux workstation that has relatively powerful hardware. We recommend that your workstation have at least 15GB of free disk space and at least 4GB of available memory so that you can download the base image and run a few virtual machine instances.

## 2. Set up your workstation for local development

This tutorial builds on the previous two, [Get started with Test Kitchen](/tutorials/local-development/rhel/) and [Manage a basic web application](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/), and has the same prerequisites.

First, you'll need to have the latest version of the Chef Development Kit on your workstation. You'll also need a programmer's text editor that you're comfortable working with and a directory to work from &ndash; the tutorials use <% fp '~/learn-chef' %>. [Follow these steps](/tutorials/manage-a-node/rhel/hosted/set-up-your-workstation/) to get set up.

You'll also need the virtualization software [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). If you don't have VirtualBox and Vagrant installed, [follow steps 1&mdash;3](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/rhel/virtualbox/set-up-a-machine-to-manage) to get set up. Optionally, you can follow steps 4&mdash;7 to verify you can successfully bring up a local virtual machine.

## 3. Build local development skills using Test Kitchen

This tutorial requires familiarity with local development using Test Kitchen.

If you're not familiar with Test Kitchen, work through [Get started with Test Kitchen](/tutorials/local-development/rhel/) before you start this tutorial. This tutorial teaches you the basics of how to apply cookbooks on local test instances, all on your workstation.

The [Manage a basic web application](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/) tutorial provides additional hands-on practice with local development. Working through this tutorial is optional. Here, you configure a basic but complete web application using Test Kitchen. The [quickstart](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/bring-up-the-web-app-using-test-kitchen/) brings up the final configuration on a local test instance in just a few minutes. This tutorial prepares you for the [appendix](/tutorials/test-your-infrastructure-code/rhel/refactor-the-web-application-cookbook/) in this tutorial which walks you through a basic refactoring exercise.

Now that you have the hang of how to use Test Kitchen to configure a local virtual machine, let's write a cookbook that configures a basic web server and see how _InSpec_ can help us automatically verify that our configuration behaves as we expect.
