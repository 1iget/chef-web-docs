# Choose your runtime environment

Just as you did in the previous tutorials, you'll bring up test instances using Test Kitchen. Choose the runtime environment where you want to run your test instances.

[COMMENT] We currently provide content for Vagrant and VirtualBox. In the future we'll add content for other desktop and cloud environments.
