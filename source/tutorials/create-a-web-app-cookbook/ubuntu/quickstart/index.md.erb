If you've gone through the tutorial previously, or you have enough familiarity with Chef and just want to see the Customers web application in action, here's how to bring things up quickly using Test Kitchen.

[START_BOX]

## Prerequisites

Your workstation must support and be configured to use CPU virtualization. This setting is typically configured through your system's BIOS. If you're using a virtual machine as your workstation through a program such as VMware Fusion, ensure that nested virtualization is enabled on the virtual machine. With some modification, [you can use another Test Kitchen driver](https://docs.chef.io/kitchen.html#drivers) if your workstation does not support CPU virtualization.

On your workstation, you'll need:

* Chef DK
* VirtualBox
* Vagrant
* Git
* a directory to work in &ndash; we recommend <% fp '~/learn-chef' %>.

[Refer to these steps](/tutorials/local-development/ubuntu/virtualbox/get-set-up/) if you're missing any of these prerequisites.

## 1. Get the sources from GitHub

Clone the sources for the `awesome_customers_ubuntu` cookbook from GitHub.

```bash
# ~
$ mkdir ~/learn-chef/cookbooks
$ cd ~/learn-chef/cookbooks
$ git clone https://github.com/learn-chef/awesome_customers_ubuntu.git
Cloning into 'awesome_customers_ubuntu'...
remote: Counting objects: 56, done.
remote: Total 56 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 56
Unpacking objects: 100% (56/56), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

## 2. Run Test Kitchen

From your cookbook's directory, <% fp '~/learn-chef/cookbooks/awesome_customers_ubuntu' %>, run `kitchen converge`.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ cd ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/awesome_customers_ubuntu
$ kitchen converge
-----> Starting Kitchen (v1.7.2)
-----> Creating <default-ubuntu-1404>...
       Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
       ==> default: Importing base box 'opscode-ubuntu-14.04'...
[...]
       Running handlers:
       Running handlers complete
       Chef Client finished, 131/213 resources updated in 07 minutes 03 seconds
       Finished converging <default-ubuntu-1404> (7m53.00s).
-----> Kitchen is finished. (8m40.54s)
```

## 4. Destroy your Test Kitchen instance

When you're done experimenting, run `kitchen destroy` to clean things up.


```bash
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/awesome_customers_ubuntu
$ kitchen destroy
-----> Starting Kitchen (v1.7.2)
-----> Destroying <default-ubuntu-1404>...
       Vagrant instance <default-ubuntu-1404> destroyed.
       Finished destroying <default-ubuntu-1404> (0m3.62s).
-----> Kitchen is finished. (0m4.43s)
```
