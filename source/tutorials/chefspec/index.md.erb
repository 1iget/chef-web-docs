# Unit test with ChefSpec

In the [Verify with InSpec](/tutorials/inspec/) tutorial, you learned how to use InSpec to automatically verify a basic web server configuration on a virtual machine running on your workstation.

Here you'll learn how to use [ChefSpec](https://docs.chef.io/chefspec.html) to speed up the feedback cycle even more by simulating the execution of your resources in memory without the need to create test instances.
