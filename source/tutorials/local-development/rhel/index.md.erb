# Choose your test environment

Test Kitchen enables you to run your cookbooks in a number of [test environments](https://docs.chef.io/kitchen.html#drivers). These test environments include cloud providers such as Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine as well as non-cloud environments such as Hyper-V and VirtualBox.

Choose where you'll run your test instances. All options provide similar content, but each is tailored to most closely match your preferred test environment.

[COMMENT] We currently provide content for Vagrant and VirtualBox. We'll add content for other commonly used test environments in the near future.
