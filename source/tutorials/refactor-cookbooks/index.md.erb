# Refactor your cookbooks

In this tutorial, you'll perform a basic refactoring exercise. You'll start by writing [ChefSpec](https://docs.chef.io/chefspec.html) tests to verify an existing database configuration. Then you'll refactor the database configuration and rerun your tests to verify the configuration still does what you expect.
