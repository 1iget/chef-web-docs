# Choose your Chef server environment

For this tutorial you'll need a [Chef server](https://docs.chef.io/server_components.html). Chef server acts as a central repository for your cookbooks as well as for information about every node it manages.

There are two ways to set up a Chef server.

1. Install an instance on your own infrastructure (there are  many options).
1. Sign up for hosted Chef and let us manage it for you.

The fastest way to set up a Chef server is to use hosted Chef. It takes only a few moments to acquire an instance and getting started is free.

Choose where you'll manage your Chef server. Again, for learning purposes, we suggest using hosted Chef. Later, you can install Chef server in the environment that most closely matches the one where you run your own servers.
