Recall that there are two ways to work with a Chef server.

1. Install Chef server on your own infrastructure.
2. Sign up for hosted Chef, a Chef server that we manage for you.

In production, the decision to use hosted Chef or manage your own Chef server depends on your team's requirements and preferences. If you're interested in setting up your own Chef server, you might want to first complete this tutorial using hosted Chef to see how Chef server works. Then you can [set up a Chef server in your environment](/tutorials/manage-a-node/ubuntu/).
