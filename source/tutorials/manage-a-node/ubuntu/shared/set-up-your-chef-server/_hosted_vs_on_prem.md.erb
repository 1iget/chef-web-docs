Recall that there are several ways to work with a Chef server.

1. Install an instance on your own infrastructure.
1. Sign up for hosted Chef, a Chef server that we manage for you.
1. Use AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate, a managed service that includes a Chef server and Chef Automate.

For production, the decision to use hosted Chef or manage your own Chef server depends on your team's requirements and preferences. If you're interested in setting up your own Chef server, you might want to first complete this tutorial using hosted Chef or OpsWorks for Chef Automate to see how Chef server works. Then you can [set up a Chef server in your environment](/tutorials/manage-a-node/ubuntu/).
