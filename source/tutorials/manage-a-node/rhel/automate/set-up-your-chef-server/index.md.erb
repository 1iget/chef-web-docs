[HEADLINE] Chef server acts as a central repository for your cookbooks as well as for information about every node it manages.<br>The `knife` command enables you to communicate with the Chef server from your workstation.

In this part, you'll set up Chef Server and Chef Automate, each on its own server. You'll also set up your workstation to work with these systems.

Recall that there are two ways to work with a Chef server.

1. Install Chef server on your own infrastructure.
2. Sign up for hosted Chef, a Chef server that we manage for you.

In production, the decision to use hosted Chef or manage your own Chef server depends on your organization's requirements and preferences.

If you're new to Chef, you might consider first working through this tutorial [using hosted Chef](/tutorials/manage-a-node/rhel/hosted/) to understand how Chef server works. You can then come back and install Chef server and Chef Automate in your environment.

[START_BOX]

## 1. Review the installation guide

The Chef documetation explains the steps required to bring up Chef Automate. We recommend that you [review the installation guide](https://docs.chef.io/install_chef_automate.html) first so you understand the procedures.

Also be sure to [review the troubleshooting section](https://docs.chef.io/install_chef_automate.html#troubleshooting). If you get stuck, [Discourse](https://discourse.chef.io/c/automate) is a great place to ask the community for help.

The following sections outline the minimal setup that's required for this tutorial. You can add [additional components](https://docs.chef.io/workflow.html#components), such as build nodes or a Chef Supermarket server, as a later time.

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 2. Bring up systems to run Chef Automate and Chef server

[Bring up two systems](https://docs.chef.io/install_chef_automate.html#platforms), one to run Chef Automate and one to run Chef server. Ensure each system [meets the infrastructure requirements](https://docs.chef.io/install_chef_automate.html#infrastructure).

  [COMMENT] For this tutorial, you don't need to configure build nodes.

### Configure the hostname and verify network access

Ensure both systems [meet the hostname and networking requirements](https://docs.chef.io/install_chef_automate.html#node-hostnames-and-network-access).

As an example, if you're setting this up on Amazon Web Services, you can [use the metadata service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html#instancedata-data-retrieval) to retrieve the hostname.

```bash
$ echo $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname) | xargs sudo hostname
```

You can assign it a hostname to your server if it is not backed by a naming service, such as DNS. For example:

```bash
$ sudo hostname chef-server.test
```

You would then need to [modify the hosts file](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/modify-your-hosts-file/) on your Chef server, workstation, and node to associate the IP address of your Chef Automate system with its hostname. You'll set up a node to manage later in this tutorial.

## 3. Install Chef server

1. [Install the Chef server package](https://docs.chef.io/install_chef_automate.html#chef-server-installation) and set up an initial user and orgnanization.

1. Copy the private key file generated by the `chef-server-ctl user-create` command (for example, <% fp '/path/to/username.pem' %>) to a directory where you can easily retrieve it later through a remote copy utility such as `scp`. Here's an example.

  ```bash
  $ cp /path/to/username.pem /tmp/username.pem
  ```
1. [Install push jobs](https://docs.chef.io/install_chef_automate.html#id3) on your Chef server.
1. [Complete the setup](https://docs.chef.io/install_chef_automate.html#id4).
1. [Create a user and organization to manage your cluster](https://docs.chef.io/install_chef_automate.html#create-a-user-and-organization-to-manage-your-cluster).
1. [Configure Chef server to send server object data](https://docs.chef.io/setup_visibility_chef_automate.html#configure-chef-server-to-send-server-object-data).

  Doing so enables Chef server to send messages to Chef Automate whenever an action is taken on a Chef server object, such as when a cookbook is uploaded to the Chef server. Here's an example. Replace <% ph 'CHEF_AUTOMATE_FQDN' %> with your Chef Automate server's FQDN. You can use the token value as shown in the example.

  ```bash
  $ echo "data_collector["root_url"] = "https://CHEF_AUTOMATE_FQDN/data-collector/v0/" | sudo tee -a /etc/opscode/chef-server.rb
  $ echo "data_collector["token"] = "93a49a4f2482c64126f7b6015e6b0f30284287ee4054ff8807fb63d9cbd1c506" | sudo tee -a /etc/opscode/chef-server.rb
  $ sudo chef-server-ctl reconfigure
  ```

Like your Chef Automate server, if your Chef server does not have a publicly resolvable hostname, you'll need to add the appropriate entries to the hosts file on your Chef Automate server, your workstation, and your node.

## 4. Install Chef Automate

1. [Install the Chef Automate package](https://docs.chef.io/install_chef_automate.html#chef-automate-server-installation-and-configuration).

  [COMMENT] A license key is required to install Chef Automate. When you download the Chef Automate package, you'll need to fill out a short form and then check your email for a link to a temporary license key for this tutorial.

1. [Create a user](https://docs.chef.io/ctl_delivery_server.html#create-user). Here's an example that creates the `delivery` user in the enterprise named `caffeine`.

  ```bash
  $ sudo delivery-ctl create-user caffeine delivery --password insecurepassword --roles "admin"
  ```

## 5. Set up your workstation

<%= partial '../../shared/set-up-your-chef-server/knife_and_rsa_key' %>

Your <code class="file-path">~/learn-chef/.chef</code> directory should contain two files:

* your `knife` configuration file, <code class="file-path">knife.rb</code>
* your RSA private key

Your `knife` configuration file should resemble this one. (`node_name`, `client_key`, and `chef_server_url` contain your information.)

<% code_snippet(page: current_page, path: 'generate-knife-config/knife-rb') %>

Copy your RSA private key file, for example, <% fp 'username.pem' %> from your Chef server to your <% fp '.chef' %> directory. Here's an example that uses `scp`. Replace <% ph 'CHEF_SERVER_IP' %> with your Chef server's IP address.

```bash
$ scp -i ~/.ssh/private_key -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null ubuntu@CHEF_SERVER_IP:/tmp/username.pem ~/learn-chef/.chef/username.pem
```

Your RSA private key should resemble this one.

```bash
# ~
$ cat ~/learn-chef/.chef/username.pem
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

After you set up your workstation, ensure that you fetch and validate the SSL certificate from your Chef server. Here's an example.

<% command_snippet(page: current_page, path: 'validate-ssl-cert/knife-ssl-fetch') %>

<% command_snippet(page: current_page, path: 'validate-ssl-cert/knife-ssl-check') %>

## 6. Log in to the Chef Automate dashboard

Chef Automate provides a web interface where you can monitor and visualize the status of your nodes. Let's take a look.

1. From a web browser, navigate to your Chef Automate server over HTTPS using its hostname, for example, **https://chef-automate.test** or **https://ec2-54-205-85-17.compute-1.amazonaws.com**.

  [COMMENT] When prompted, accept the server's certificate. Chef Automate's comes with a self-signed SSL certificate. In a production environment, you would typically set up a certificate chain that's rooted by a trusted certificate authority (CA) to enable the Chef Automate server to verify its authenticity.

1. Sign in using the Chef Automate user you set up in [step 4](#step4).

  ![](manage-a-node/chef_automate_sign_in.png)

1. The Chef Automate dashboard appears. Select the **Nodes** tab.

  ![](manage-a-node/chef_automate_nodes_tab.png)

Notice that the **Nodes** dashboard is initially empty. During the bootstrap process, your nodes will do an initial `chef-client` run and report data back to Chef Automate. You'll do that shortly.

![](manage-a-node/chef_automate_nodes_initial_state.png)

Leave your browser window open for the next part.

At this point, you have a Chef server and a Chef Automate server set up and your workstation is configured to work with them.

Chef server gives you a persistent location to store your cookbooks and information about your nodes. The `knife` command enables you to communicate with the Chef server. Chef Automate's visibilty feature gives you insight into what's happening on your Chef server.

Next, you'll get a copy of the `learn_chef_httpd` cookbook that you wrote in the previous tutorial and upload it to your Chef server.
