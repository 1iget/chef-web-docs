# Choose your Chef server environment

For this tutorial you'll need a [Chef server](https://docs.chef.io/server_components.html). Chef server acts as a central repository for your cookbooks as well as for information about every node it manages.

There are several ways to set up a Chef server.

1. Sign up for hosted Chef and let us manage it for you.
1. Use [AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/welcome_opscm.html), a managed service that runs on Amazon Web Services that includes a Chef server and [Chef Automate](https://docs.chef.io/chef_automate.html).
1. Install an instance on your own infrastructure (there are many options).

Hosted Chef and OpsWorks for Chef Automate are the fastest ways to set up a Chef server. It takes only a few moments to acquire an instance and getting started is free.
