# Choose your Chef server environment

For this tutorial you'll need a [Chef server](https://docs.chef.io/server_components.html). Chef server acts as a central repository for your cookbooks as well as for information about every node it manages.

There are two ways to work with a Chef server.

1. Install an instance on your own infrastructure.
1. Sign up for hosted Chef and let us manage it for you.

The fastest way to set up a Chef server is to use hosted Chef. It takes only a few moments and is free to get started.

Choose where you'll manage your Chef server. For learning purposes, choose the environment you're most comfortable with. Later, you can install Chef server in the environment that most closely matches where you run your servers.
