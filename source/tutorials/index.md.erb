## What you'll find in the tutorials

Because Chef can be run in many different environments, many tutorials come in multiple versions, each tailored to a specific server, cloud, or virtualization platform. Here's a quick look at what you'll accomplish in each tutorial.

### Get started with Chef

In [Learn the basics](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/), you'll learn how Chef's _test and repair_ approach keeps your systems in line with the policies you describe. You'll learn how to use resources, recipes, and cookbooks to configure a system you provide or a free trial virtual machine that we provide.
