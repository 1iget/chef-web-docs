## Awesome!

Congrats, you've successfully used Chef to configure your web server validated that it can serve up a basic web page. You now have a cookbook and a recipe that you can extend further or use as a template for something else. You also know how to run **chef-client** to update your configuration when things change. And you can do it all on Windows Server or Linux.
