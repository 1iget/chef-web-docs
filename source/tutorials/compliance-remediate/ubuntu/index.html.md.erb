# Choose your operating environment

This tutorial builds on the previous, [Scan for compliance](/tutorials/compliance-assess/). There, you brought up two systems &ndash; the Chef compliance scanner and a node to scan &ndash; in your environment.

In this tutorial, you'll also bring up a Chef server.

The easiest way to get started is to bring up your systems in the environment you prefer. The pages that follow explain everything you'll need to get set up.
