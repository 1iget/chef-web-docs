This tutorial comes in two parts.

In the first part, [Remediate the compliance failure on a local virtual machine](/tutorials/compliance-remediate/ubuntu/remediate-the-compliance-failure-on-a-local-virtual-machine/), you'll replicate and remediate the failure of the **Ensure Firewall is active** rule on a local virtual machine.

In the second part, [Remediate the compliance failure on your node](/tutorials/compliance-remediate/ubuntu/remediate-the-compliance-failure-on-your-node/), you'll apply the remediation to your node and rerun the compliance scan to verify that the node's firewall configuration satisfies the **Ensure Firewall is active** rule.

Both parts use Chef and require a basic understanding of:

* Chef's _test and repair_ approach.
* working with a Chef server.
* local development using Test Kitchen.
* working with the Chef compliance scanner.

Use the following sections as a guide to learning the prerequisite skills.

[START_BOX]

## Chef's test and repair approach

If you're new to Chef, we recommend that you first work through the [Learn the Chef basics](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/ubuntu/free/) tutorial. You'll learn about Chef's test and repair approach by writing a Chef cookbook that brings up a basic web server configuration. We provide a free Ubuntu virtual machine that runs in your browser.

## Working with a Chef server

If you don't have a Chef server, the [Manage a node](/manage-a-node/ubuntu/) tutorial gets you started. You'll learn how Chef server acts as a central repository for your cookbooks as well as for information about every node it manages. You'll sign up for hosted Chef and learn how to manage an Ubuntu server remotely from your workstation.

As an optional step, you can follow the [Install and manage your own Chef server](/install-and-manage-your-own-chef-server/linux/) tutorial to learn how to set up a Chef server that you manage.

## Local development using Test Kitchen

If you're not familiar with local development using Test Kitchen, check out the [Develop your infrastructure code locally](/local-development/ubuntu/) tutorial. You'll learn how to use Test Kitchen along with the virtualization tools VirtualBox and Vagrant to develop and verify your infrastructure code _before_ you apply the configuration to your production servers.

As an optional exercise, the [Manage a basic web application](/manage-a-web-app/ubuntu/) tutorial provides additional hands-on practice with local development. Here, you configure a basic but complete web application using Test Kitchen. The [quickstart](/manage-a-web-app/ubuntu/bring-up-the-web-app-using-test-kitchen/) brings up the final configuration on a local test instance in minutes.

## Working with the Chef compliance scanner

For this tutorial, you'll need a Chef compliance scanner installation and an Ubuntu 14.04 node that leaves Ubuntu's default firewall, UFW, inactive.

Be sure to complete the previous tutorial, [Assess your infrastructure with the Chef compliance scanner](/tutorials/compliance-assess/ubuntu/), before starting this one.

[COMMENT] This tutorial uses Chef server and Chef compliance scanner as standalone components. Although not required,  you can later [integrate Chef Complance with Chef server](https://docs.chef.io/integrate_compliance_chef_server.html) to enable Chef compliance scanner users to log in using their Chef server credentials and enable nodes to download Chef compliance scanner profiles, run them, and send the results back to Chef compliance scanner.
