# Choose your server environment

For this tutorial you'll need a [Chef Automate](https://docs.chef.io/chef_automate.html) installation that's connected to a [Chef server](https://docs.chef.io/server_components.html).

Here are two ways to set up Chef Automate and a Chef server.

1. Use [AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate](https://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/chefautomate/?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=ops-works-chef-automate-launch-2016&sc_publisher=chef&sc_country=global&sc_geo=global&sc_category=opsworks-chef-automate&sc_outcome=devadopt), a managed service that runs on Amazon Web Services that includes Chef Automate and a Chef server.
1. Install Chef Automate and Chef server instances on your own infrastructure.

Choose the environment where you'll run your systems.

[COMMENT] We currently provide content for OpsWorks for Chef Automate. In the future we'll add content for managing your own installation.
