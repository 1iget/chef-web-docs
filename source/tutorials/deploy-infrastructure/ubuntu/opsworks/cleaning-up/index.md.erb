## Deleting the Chef Automate project

[PRODNOTE] Perhaps move this to the end of the tutorial (or as an appendix?) and update links.

If you ever need to start over, or you complete the tutorial and want to delete this project, you'll need to log in to the Chef Automate server (for example, over SSH) and run the `delivery-ctl delete-project` command.

The Windows workstation [provides a hosts file and SSH config](/automate/install/managing-your-aws-instances#connectingtoyourawsinstancesfromthewindowsworkstation) to make it easy to access each system over SSH.

Here's how to connect to the Chef Automate server over SSH.

```ps
$ ssh delivery.chordata.biz
```

The `delivery-ctl delete-project` command takes your enterprise, organization, and project names as arguments, like this.

```bash
$ sudo delivery-ctl delete-project ENTERPRISE ORGANIZATION PROJECT
```

Here's how to delete the `learn_chef_apache2` project in the tutorial environment from your SSH session:

```bash
$ sudo delivery-ctl delete-project mammalia diprotodontia learn_chef_apache2
Successfully deleted project: 'mammalia/diprotodontia/learn_chef_apache2'
```
