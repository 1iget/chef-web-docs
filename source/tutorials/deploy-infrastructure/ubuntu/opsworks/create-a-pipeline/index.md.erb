In this part, you'll obtain a starter project from GitHub and move it through Chef Automate's pipeline.

In the _Manage a node_ tutorial, you downloaded an example cookbook named `learn_chef_apache2` from GitHub and [uploaded that cookbook](/tutorials/manage-a-node/ubuntu/opsworks/upload-a-cookbook/) to your Chef Automate server. You'll continue with that cookbook in this tutorial.

[START_BOX]

## 1. Get the learn\_chef_apache2 cookbook

In case you no longer have the `learn_chef_apache2` cookbook available, here's how to get a copy from GitHub and upload it to your Chef Automate server.

```bash
$ cd ~/learn-chef/cookbooks
$ git clone https://github.com/learn-chef/learn_chef_apache2.git
$ cd learn_chef_apache2
$ knife cookbook upload learn_chef_apache2
$ knife cookbook list
```

You can examine the cookbook to familiarize yourself with its contents.

## 3. See the change move through the pipeline

(If you have multiple buid nodes, you'll see Unit, Lint, and Syntax phases run in parallel)

Talk about approving it, borrow text from other tutorial.

Move through rest of the pipeline - explain what happens (or doesn't yet!) during each stage.

Integrate change into local `master`
