In this part, you'll follow these steps to bring up a CentOS 7 instance on Google Compute Engine.

1. [Access your Google account](#step1)
1. [Launch a CentOS 7 instance](#step2)
1. [If you're running Windows &ndash; verify your SSH client](#step3)
1. [Connect to your CentOS instance](#step4)
1. [Install the Chef DK on your CentOS instance](#step5)
1. [Prepare a text editor on your CentOS instance](#step6)

You'll also learn how to [clean up](#cleaningup) your virtual machine when you're done with this tutorial.

[TIP] This tutorial discusses CentOS 7, but you can also use Windows Server 7.

## A note about machine images and versions

The sample output you see might differ depending on the Azure machine image that you choose. The version of the Chef Development Kit that you use can also affect the output that you see.

For technical support with Azure, [read the FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/faq/), [visit the Azure forums](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/forums/), or [contact support](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/options/). We're also happy to help as best we can.

## 1. Access your Google Cloud Platform account

Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account. If you don't have an account, Google is offering a [60-day free trial](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) for up to $300 (USD) of usage.

Keep in mind that billing is done through your Google account on an hourly basis. If you are unable to use Google Cloud Platform, you can [try a different option](/tutorials/#learn-the-basics) for this tutorial.

## 2. Launch a CentOS 7 Compute Engine instance

Next, bring up a CentOS instance on Compute Engine.

If you're new to Compute Engine, Google's [Quickstart Using a Linux VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart-linux) tutorial walks you through the creation of your first Linux virtual machine.

[COMMENT] This tutorial refers to the Google Cloud Platform Console documentation to help you manage your virtual machine. Google also provides a [command-line interface](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute/) (CLI).

When you're ready to continue with this tutorial, bring up a standard **CentOS 7** or **Windows Server 7** system.

When you choose the machine type, select **micro**, **small**, or **1 vCPU**. **micro** instances cost less, but **small** or **1 vCPU** will give you better performance.

[COMMENT] Google provides a monthly price estimate for your virtual machine. You'll need only about an hour to complete this tutorial, so the final cost will be about 10&cent; (USD). Just be sure to destroy your instance when you're done.

When you choose the firewall settings, select **Allow HTTP traffic** and **Allow HTTP traffic**. This ensures your system is connectable on ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS).

[COMMENT] Technically, port 443 is not required for this tutorial. But setting up that port now prepares you for the next tutorial, where you'll configure your server to be managed remotely.

## 3. If you're running Windows &ndash; verify your SSH client

In this tutorial, you'll connect to your Linux instance over SSH. To do so, you'll need an SSH client. Mac OS and most Linux distributions come with an SSH client. On Windows, you need to install one.

The easiest way to set up an SSH client is to install the Chef Development Kit (Chef DK) on your workstation. Chef DK version 0.15 and later comes with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win), which includes an SSH client.

Installing the Chef DK now also prepares you for the next tutorial, where you'll use Chef to manage a server remotely from your workstation.

There are two ways to install the Chef DK on Windows.

1. [Download and run the installer](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/) from the Chef downloads page.
2. Run the installer from PowerShell.

<% command_snippet(path: 'learn-the-basics/windows/vmware_fusion/set-up-a-machine-to-manage/install-the-chef-dk/install-chefdk', workstation: 'windows') %>

After you install the Chef DK, verify that Git and an SSH client are set up properly.

First, open the **Chef Development Kit** shortcut from the desktop or **Start** menu. Open the shortcut as **Adminstrator**.

Next, run these commands.

<% command_snippet(path: 'learn-the-basics/windows/vmware_fusion/set-up-a-machine-to-manage/verify-your-ssh-client/git--version', workstation: 'windows') %>

<% command_snippet(path: 'learn-the-basics/windows/vmware_fusion/set-up-a-machine-to-manage/verify-your-ssh-client/ssh-no-args', workstation: 'windows', features: [:stderr, :stdin]) %>

Keep your **Chef Development Kit** window open for the next part.

## 4. Connect to your CentOS instance

Next, connect to your instance.

The Google documention shows a [few ways to connect](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance), including [connecting from your browser](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance#sshinbrowser).

Here's an example of how to connect over SSH from the command line using key-based authentication. (Replace <% fp '~/.ssh/id_rsa' %> with the path to your private key file, <% ph 'chef' %> with your username, and <% ph '104.196.49.219' %> with your IP address.)

```bash
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa chef@104.196.49.219
Last login: Fri Aug 12 16:35:54 2016 from 96.228.248.180
[tpetchel@centos-compute ~]$
```

## 5. Install the Chef DK on your CentOS instance

Remember, for learning purposes, you'll start by managing a server directly. To do that, you'll install the Chef DK on your virtual machine. The Chef DK provides tools that enable you to manage your servers remotely from your workstation. But it also provides tools that allow you to configure a machine directly.

From your SSH connection, run this from the command line to install the Chef DK.

<% command_snippet(path: 'learn-the-basics/windows/compute/set-up-your-own-server/install-the-chef-dk/install-chefdk', workstation: 'centos', features: [:stdin, :stderr, :stdout]) %>

The `-c` and `-v` arguments specify the Chef DK version this tutorial was last tested with.

[START_BOX]

## 6. Prepare a text editor on your CentOS instance

Because Chef uses code to express infrastructure policy, it's important that you use a text editor that provides features such as syntax highlighting and line numbering.

From your SSH connection, install a text editor now. Because you're accessing your server from an SSH connection, choose a command-line text editor such as `emacs`, `nano`, or `vim`.

If you're new to using command-line text editors on CentOS, here are some resources to help get you started.

<% accordion('emacs-gs', 'Emacs') do %>

<%= partial 'layouts/partials/emacs_gs_windows' %>

<% end %>

<% accordion('nano-gs', 'Nano') do %>

<%= partial 'layouts/partials/nano_gs_windows' %>

<% end %>

<% accordion('vim-gs', 'Vim') do %>

<%= partial 'layouts/partials/vim_gs_windows' %>

<% end %>

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## Cleaning up

Remember, billing is done through your Google account on an hourly basis. After you complete the tutorial, be sure to [destroy your virtual machine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/stopping-or-deleting-an-instance#"delete_an_instance).

Or, you can leave your server running if you want to use it to complete the next tutorial. You can temporarily [stop and later resume](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/stopping-or-deleting-an-instance#stop_an_instance) your instance to reduce cost.

Now that you have your virtual machine with the Chef DK and a text editor set up, let's use Chef to configure a file, a kind of _resource_, on it.
