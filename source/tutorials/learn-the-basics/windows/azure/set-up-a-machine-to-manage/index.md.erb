In this part, you'll bring up a Windows Server 2012 R2 instance on Microsoft Azure.

You'll also learn how to [clean up](#cleaningup) your virtual machine when you're done with this tutorial.

<% accordion('test-configuration', 'Test configuration', true) do %>

The sample output you see might differ depending on the Azure machine image that you choose. The version of the Chef Development Kit that you use can also affect the output that you see. We recommend that you install the components as directed in the tutorial, using the specific versions that have been tested.

For technical support with Azure, [read the FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/faq/), [visit the Azure forums](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/forums/), or [contact support](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/options/). We're also happy to help as best we can.

[START_BOX]

## 1. Access your Azure account

Log in to your Azure account. If you don't have an account, Microsoft is offering a [30-day free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) for up to $200 (USD) of usage.

Keep in mind that billing is done through your Azure account on an hourly basis. If you are unable to use Azure, you can [try a different option](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/windows/) for this tutorial.

## 2. Launch a Windows Server 2012 R2 instance

Next, bring up a Windows Server instance on Azure.

If you're new to Azure, their [Create your first Windows virtual machine in the Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-hero-tutorial/) tutorial walks you through the creation of your first Windows Server virtual machine.

[COMMENT] This tutorial refers to the Azure Portal documentation to help you manage your virtual machine. You can also create a virtual machine from [PowerShell](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-ps-create/) or from the Azure [command-line interface](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-quick-create-cli/) (CLI).


When you're ready to continue with this tutorial, bring up a **Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter** instance, published by Microsoft Windows Server Group.

When you choose the instance size, select **DS1_V2 Standard**.

[COMMENT] You'll need only about an hour to complete this tutorial, so the final cost will be less than 30&cent; (USD). Just be sure to destroy your instance when you're done.

You can leave the remaining settings at their default values. If you choose to [assign a network security group](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-create-nsg-arm-pportal/) to your instance, be sure to enable access on ports 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 3389 (RDP), and 5985 (WinRM).

[COMMENT] Technically, port 443 is not required for this tutorial. But setting up that port now prepares you for the next tutorial, where you'll configure your server to be managed remotely.

## 3. Connect to your Windows Server instance

Next, create a Remote Desktop connection to your instance. The Microsoft documention explains [how to connect using an RDP client](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-hero-tutorial/#connect-to-the-virtual-machine-and-log-on).

## 4. Install the Chef DK on your Windows Server instance

Remember, for learning purposes, you'll start by managing a server directly. To do that, you'll install the Chef DK on your virtual machine. The Chef DK provides tools that enable you to manage your servers remotely from your workstation. But it also provides tools that allow you to configure a machine directly.

From your Remote Desktop connection, run this from the command line to install the Chef DK.

<% command_snippet(path: 'learn-the-basics/windows/azure/set-up-your-own-server/install-the-chef-dk/install-chefdk', workstation: 'windows', features: [:stdin, :stdout]) %>

The `-channel` and `-version` arguments specify the Chef DK version this tutorial was last tested with.

[START_BOX]

## 5. Prepare a text editor on your Windows Server instance

Because Chef uses code to express infrastructure policy, it's important that you use a text editor that provides features such as syntax highlighting and line numbering.

From your Remote Desktop connection, install a text editor now.

If you don't have a preferred text editor, here are some that are popular among Chef users:

* [Atom](http://atom.io)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com)

## Cleaning up

Remember, billing is done through your Azure account. After you complete the tutorial, be sure to destroy your virtual machine. Or, you can leave your server running if you want to use it to complete the next tutorial.

You can destroy your virtual machine from the Azure Portal, [PowerShell](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-ps-manage/#delete-a-virtual-machine), or from the [CLI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/azure-cli-arm-commands/#azure-vm-commands-to-manage-your-azure-virtual-machines).

Now that you have your virtual machine with the Chef DK and a text editor set up, let's use Chef to configure a file, a kind of _resource_, on it.
