This tutorial relies on a Windows Server 2012 R2 system that you provide.

If you use Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, VirtualBox, or want to use a free trial virtual machine that runs in your browser, you can [switch to a different option](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/windows/) for this tutorial.

<% accordion('test-configuration', 'Test configuration') do %>

The sample output you see might differ depending on your operating system and software versions. We recommend that you install the components as directed in the tutorial, using the specific versions that have been tested.

## 1. Bring up a Windows Server 2012 R2 system

Bring up a Windows Server 2012 R2 system as you normally would. To enable you to experiment, we recommend using a system that you can easily destroy and bring back up, such as a virtual machine or cloud instance. Your instance might run on virtualization software such as Hyper-V or VMWare Fusion, your preferred cloud provider, your datacenter, or spare hardware.

[COMMENT] Remember, [we provide versions of this tutorial](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/windows/) specifically for AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, VirtualBox, or on a free virtual machine.

Ensure that your system:

* provides Administrator access.
* has a resolvable IP address.
* can access the Internet.
* provides network access on ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS).

Although Chef can be run completely from behind the firewall, using a system with Internet access is the easiest way to install packages and perform other common tasks.

[COMMENT] Technically, port 443 is not required for this tutorial. But setting up that port now prepares you for the next tutorial, where you'll configure your server to be managed remotely.

## 2. Connect to your system

If youâ€™re physically at your Linux machine, login now as `root` or a user with `sudo` access. Otherwise, connect to your instance over SSH.

Here's an example of how to connect over SSH using key-based authentication. (Replace <% fp '~/.ssh/id_rsa' %> with the path to your private key file, <% ph 'user' %> with your username, and <% ph '10.20.30.40' %> with your IP address.)

```bash
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@10.20.30.40
The authenticity of host '10.20.30.40 (10.20.30.40)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:YiT1n9QZ64GnXcCeRpYMOLxpJZ9IjCft1Fpf5tvAFuQ.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '10.20.30.40' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
Last login: Thu Aug 11 21:02:18 2016 from 96.228.248.180
[user@hostname ~]$
```

Here's an example using password authentication.

```bash
$ ssh user@10.20.30.40
The authenticity of host '40.76.28.32 (40.76.28.32)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:YiT1n9QZ64GnXcCeRpYMOLxpJZ9IjCft1Fpf5tvAFuQ.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '40.76.28.32' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
user@10.20.30.40's password:
Last login: Thu Aug 11 21:08:30 2016 from 96.228.248.180
[user@hostname ~]$
```

## 3. Install the Chef DK on your system

Remember, for learning purposes, you'll start by managing a server directly. To do that, you'll install the Chef DK on your system. The Chef DK provides tools that enable you to manage your servers remotely from your workstation. But it also provides tools that allow you to configure a machine directly.

From your system, run this from the command line to install the Chef DK.

<% command_snippet(path: 'learn-the-basics/windows/vmware_fusion/set-up-your-own-server/install-the-chef-dk/install-chefdk', workstation: 'windows', replace_prompt: current_page.data.replace_prompt, features: [:stdin, :stdout]) %>

The `-channel` and `-version` arguments specify the Chef DK version this tutorial was last tested with.

## 4. Prepare a text editor on your system

Because Chef uses code to express infrastructure policy, it's important that you use a text editor that provides features such as syntax highlighting and line numbering.

From your system, install a text editor now. If you're accessing your server from an SSH connection, choose a command-line text editor such as `emacs`, `nano`, or `vim`. Otherwise, you can install a command-line text editor or a graphical editor.

If you're new to using command-line text editors on Linux, here are some resources to help get you started.

## Cleaning up

If you used a cloud instance for this tutorial, remember to destroy your instance after you're done to reduce billing charges.

Or, you can leave your server running if you want to use it to complete the next tutorial. Some cloud providers enable you to temporarily suspend instances to reduce cost.

Now that you have your virtual machine with the Chef DK and a text editor set up, let's use Chef to configure a file, a kind of _resource_, on it.
