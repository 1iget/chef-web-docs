If you run your servers in the cloud, you might be interested in the [AWS](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/windows/aws/), [Azure](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/windows/azure/), or [Compute Engine](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/windows/compute/) options. Billing is done through your cloud account.

You can also [bring your own system](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/windows/bring-your-own-system/) using your own hardware or a different cloud or virtualization provider.
