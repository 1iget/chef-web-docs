## Choose your operating environment

Next, choose where you'll manage your Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS server. All options provide similar content, but each is tailored to most closely match where you run your servers.

The [free virtual machine](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/rhel/free/) option is the easiest way to get started.

<hr />

If you run your servers in the cloud, you might be interested in the [AWS](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/rhel/aws/), [Azure](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/rhel/azure/), or [Compute Engine](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/rhel/compute/) options. Billing is done through your cloud account.

The [Vagrant and VirtualBox](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/rhel/virtualbox/) option uses a virtual machine that runs on your Windows, Mac OS, or Linux workstation.

You can also [bring your own system](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/rhel/bring-your-own-system/) using your own hardware or a different cloud or virtualization provider.
