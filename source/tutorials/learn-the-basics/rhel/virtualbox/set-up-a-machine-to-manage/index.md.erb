[START_BOX]

## Before you begin

[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) are free virtualization tools that enable you to manage virtual machine instances on your workstation.

In this part, you'll install VirtualBox and Vagrant and bring up a CentOS 7 instance to work with. Before you begin, ensure that:

* your workstation supports and is configured to use CPU virtualization. This setting is typically configured through your system's BIOS.
* your workstation meets the [system requirements](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/End-user_documentation) requirements for running VirtualBox.
* your workstation has at least 5GB of free disk space. This will enable you to download the base image and run a few virtual machine instances.
* your workstation has at least 256MB memory available per virtual machine instance.
* nested virtualization is enabled if you're using another virtual machine as your workstation through a program such as VMWare Fusion.

If you are unable to run virtual machines on your workstation, you can [try a different option](/tutorials/#learn-the-basics) for this tutorial.
