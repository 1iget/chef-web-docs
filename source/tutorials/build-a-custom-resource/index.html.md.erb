# Build a custom resource

In this tutorial, you'll walk through the creation of a [custom Chef resource](https://docs.chef.io/custom_resources.html) that configures Apache web server on multiple Linux platforms. You'll get starter code from GitHub, see the custom resource in action, and run automated tests that verify the resource's behavior.

## Choose your server environment

Click on one of the buttons below to select the kind of system you want to work with.
