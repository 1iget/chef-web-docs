Now that you're performed the prerequisite tasks, you're ready to install and configure Chef Analytics on your system. In this part, you'll:

* prepare your Chef server to communicate with Chef Analytics, including installing the reporting feature.
* install and configure Chef Analytics on its own server.
* verify that Chef Analytics is configured and sign in to the web interface.
* run `chef-client` on a node and watch the result appear in the Chef Analytics web interface.

To successfully configure Chef Analytics, you'll also need to set up a few things on your Chef server. So make sure you have access to both Chef server and Chef Analytics servers, including:

* their public IP addresses.
* the user names and passwords (or identity files) that you use to log on.

[COMMENT] We use `sudo` to highlight where root access is required. You can omit `sudo` from the commands if you're running as the root user.
