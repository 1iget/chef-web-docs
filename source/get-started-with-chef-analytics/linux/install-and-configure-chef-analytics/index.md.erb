Now that you're performed the prerequisite tasks, you're ready to install and configure Chef Analytics on your system.

[COMMENT] We use `sudo` to highlight where root access is required. You can omit `sudo` from the commands if you're running as the root user.

To successfully configure Chef Analtyics, you'll also need to set up a few things on your Chef server. So make sure you have access to both systems.

Also have available the hostname of the machines running Chef server and Chef Analytics.
