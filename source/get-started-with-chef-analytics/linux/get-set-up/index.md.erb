You'll need these four systems to complete this tutorial:

* Your workstation
* A node to manage
* A dedicated server to run Chef server
* A dedicated server to run Chef Analytics

Chef server and Chef Analytics typically exist on separate systems due to the heavy processing requirements of Chef Analytics.

[COMMENT] Another option to set up a Chef Analytics system is to install Chef server from the AWS Marketplace. The AWS Marketplace image includes Chef server and Chef Analytics. The [Learn to install and manage your own Chef server](/install-and-manage-your-own-chef-server/linux) tutorial shows you how &ndash; just follow the AWS Marketplace instructions to get started.
