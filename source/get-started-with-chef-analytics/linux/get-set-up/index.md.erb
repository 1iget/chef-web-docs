1. outbound network access on port 25 (SMTP).
1. a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that can be accessed from your workstation, Chef Analytics, and your node.

[COMMENT] In this lesson, you'll set up a mail server on port 25. You can choose a different port if you require it.


Supported platforms for Chef server:

https://docs.chef.io/install_server_pre.html#supported-platforms


In this lesson, you'll set up your workstation with the Chef tools and start up the servers you'll need in your network.

Remember, your node can be any physical machine, virtual machine, or cloud instance, as long as:

* its IP address is accessible from your network.
* it has inbound network access on ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) and outbound network access on port 443 (HTTPS).
* it meets the [system requirements](https://docs.chef.io/chef_system_requirements.html#chef-client) for running `chef-client`.
* you have root or `sudo` access.

WinRM 2.0 uses port 5985 for HTTP and port 5986 for HTTPS traffic, by default.
