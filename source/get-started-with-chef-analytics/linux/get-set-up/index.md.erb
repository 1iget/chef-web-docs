You'll need these four systems to complete this tutorial:

* Your workstation
* A node to manage
* A dedicated server to run Chef server
* A dedicated server to run Chef Analytics

Chef server and Chef Analytics must exist on separate systems due to the heavy processing requirements of Chef Analytics. You can also connect Chef Analytics to more than one Chef server. But in this tutorial, we'll focus on connecting Chef Analytics to just one Chef server.

In this tutorial, you'll prepare each of these systems for use with Chef Analytics.
