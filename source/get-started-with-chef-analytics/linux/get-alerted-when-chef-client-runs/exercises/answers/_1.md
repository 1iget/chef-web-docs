From the **Rules** tab, click **+** to create a new rule and name it `alert_on_cookbook_upload`. Then from the rule editor, add this rule.

```ruby
rules 'alert_on_cookbook_upload'
  rule on action
  when
    (task = 'create' or task = 'update') and
    parent_type = 'cookbook'
  then
    alert:info("{{ message.requestor_name }} uploaded cookbook {{ message.parent_name }} version {{ message.entity_name }} to {{ message.service_hostname }} at {{ message.recorded_at }}.")
  end
end
```

This rule triggers when a cookbook is created or updated on the Chef server. The alert message body includes the user who uploaded the cookbook, the name of the cookbook, its version, the hostname of the Chef server, and the time the action was recorded.

To test the notification, upload the `hello_chef_server` or any other cookbook to your Chef server.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef/chef-repo
$ knife cookbook upload hello_chef_server
Uploading hello_chef_server [0.1.0]
Uploaded 1 cookbook.
```

From the **Alerts** tab in the web interface you'll see an alert similar to this.
