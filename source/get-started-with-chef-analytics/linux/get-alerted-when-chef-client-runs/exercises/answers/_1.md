Here's one way to modify things so that a different email notification is sent depending on whether the `chef-client` run succeeded or failed.

```ruby
rules 'email_me_every_converge'
  rule 'succeeded run' on run_converge
  when
    status = 'success'
  then
    notify('send_email', '<b>{{ message.node_name }}</b> successfully converged at {{ message.end_time }}. {{ message.updated_resource_count }}/{{ message.total_resource_count }} resources were updated.')
  end

  rule 'failed run' on run_converge
  when
    status = 'failure'
  then
    notify('send_email', '<b>{{ message.node_name }}</b> failed to converge at {{ message.end_time }}. You can find the error log here:<br/><br/>https://{{ message.chef_server_fqdn }}/organizations/{{ message.organization_name }}/runs/{{ message.run_id }}/error_log')
  end
end
```

You can use HTML tags in the message body &ndash; this example uses bold and line breaks to enhance readability.

When you run `chef-client` on your node, you'll receive an email notification similar to this one.

To test the failure case, you can modify your default recipe to install a package that you know doesn't exist.

```ruby
# default.rb
package 'nothing'
```

Then, upload your cookbook to the Chef server.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ knife cookbook upload hello_chef_server
Uploading hello_chef_server [0.1.0]
Uploaded 1 cookbook.
```

When you run `chef-client` on your node, you'll receive an email notification similar to this.
