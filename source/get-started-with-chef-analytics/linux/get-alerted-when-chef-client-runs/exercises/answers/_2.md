From the **Rules** tab, click **+** to create a new rule and name it `email_on_cookbook_upload`. Then from the rule editor, add this rule.

```ruby
rules 'email_me_on_cookbook_upload'
  rule on action
  when
    (task = 'create' or task = 'update') and
    parent_type = 'cookbook'
  then
    notify('send_email', '{{ message.requestor_name }} uploaded cookbook {{ message.parent_name }} version {{ message.entity_name }} to {{ message.service_hostname }} at {{ message.recorded_at }}.')
  end
end
```

This rule triggers when a cookbook is created or updated on the Chef server. The message body includes the user who uploaded the cookbook, the name of the cookbook, its version, the hostname of the Chef server, and the time the action was recorded.

To test the notification, create an cookbook and upload it to your Chef server.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ chef generate cookbook cookbooks/test1
Compiling Cookbooks...
[...]
    - update content in file /home/user/chef-repo/cookbooks/test1/.gitignore from none to dd37b2
    (diff output suppressed by config)
$ knife cookbook upload test1
Uploading test1          [0.1.0]
Uploaded 1 cookbook.
```

You'll receive an email notification, similar to this.
