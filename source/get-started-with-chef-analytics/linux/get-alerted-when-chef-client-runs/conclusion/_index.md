In this tutorial, you installed and configured Chef Analytics and wrote your first rule. Although your rule is basic, it demonstrates the power of the rules language and notifications. You can learn more about [common tasks](https://docs.chef.io/analytics_webui_tasks.html) and find [additional examples](https://docs.chef.io/analytics_rules.html#examples) in the Chef documentation.

Alerts give you a persistent way to store important events that happen in your network. They're also a useful way to test out new rules. Notifications go one step further by pushing events directly to your team through instance messaging or other monitoring services. Here's an example [from this blog post](https://www.chef.io/blog/2015/07/24/chef-analytics-slack-awesome/) where we share how Chef uses Chef Analytics to integrate with Slack.
