Whether you're managing ten nodes or ten thousand, having real-time visibility into what's happening on the Chef server can help you stay on top of your Chef infrastructure. For example, say you want to know:

* when are users updating cookbooks?
* what changes were made immediately before my cookbook stopped working?
* when are new nodes added or existing ones removed?
* are my servers meeting our compliance requirements each time `chef-client` runs?

To answer these questions, you could periodically check the Chef management console or run `knife` to get the current state of your infrastructure. But pulling data doesn't give you a real-time view into your infrastructure. You could have nodes report back, for example, by writing a [handler](https://docs.chef.io/handlers.html), when events you care about occur. But that would require you to set up a reporting mechanism on each node, which is extra process to maintain and something that's likely not realistic in production.

That's where Chef Analytics comes in. Chef Analytics provides real-time visibility into what is happening on the Chef server, including whatâ€™s changing, who made those changes, and when they occurred.

Chef Analytics enables you to write _rules_, which describe the events you care about, and _notifications_, which are the actions that occur in response to an event. A notification can be in the form of an email, a post to the HipChat instant messaging service, or a post to your HTTP service.

In this tutorial, you'll set up a Chef Analytics server, connect it to your Chef server, and configure it to email you when your node completes a `chef-client` run.

After completing this lesson, you'll be able to:

* install and configure Chef Analytics and connect it to your Chef server.
* use the Chef Analytics web interface to view events that happen on your Chef server.
* notify your team when `chef-client` completes on a node.

Let's get started by performing the prerequisite tasks to run Chef Analytics.
