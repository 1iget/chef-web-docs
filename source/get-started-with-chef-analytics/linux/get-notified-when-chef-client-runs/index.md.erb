[HEADLINE] Notifications help keep your team informed of important events that occur on your Chef server.

In this part, you'll set up a _notification_, or an action that occurs in response to an event, and a _rule_, or the conditions that define which events cause a notification to be sent.

A notification can be sent through email, HipChat, Splunk, or to any HTTP endpoint. In this lesson, you'll set up an email notification. The rule will be to send the email notification when a `chef-client` run completes.
