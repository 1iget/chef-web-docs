Click the title, `New Email 1`, and rename it to `send_email`. Then fill in the form fields with values that make sense for your company. If your SMTP server requires authentication, enter the username and password as well. Then click **Save**.

[TIP] If you installed a mail server on your Chef Analytics system, set the **Hostname** field to `localhost` and leave **Username** and **Password** blank.
