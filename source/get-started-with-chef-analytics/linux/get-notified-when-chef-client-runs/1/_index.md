## 1. Set up a mail server

You can use your organization's SMTP email server for this tutorial if you are able to. If you do so, youâ€™ll need to know your SMTP server's hostname and username and password if it requires authentication. But for learning purposes, you can also set up a basic mail server on the system running Chef Analytics.

If you want to set up a basic mail server, run the command for the operating system your Chef Analytics server is running on.

[TIP] You may have to update your operating system's package cache before you install the package.

#### Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS

```bash
$ sudo yum install mailx
```

#### Ubuntu

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install mailutils
```

From the configuration screen that appears, choose **Internet Site**. You can leave the other settings at their default values.
