In this tutorial, you installed and configured Chef Analytics and wrote your first rule. Although your rule is basic, it demonstrates the power of the rules language and notifications. You can learn more about [common tasks](https://docs.chef.io/analytics_webui_tasks.html) and find [additional examples](https://docs.chef.io/analytics_rules.html#examples) in the Chef documentation.

In the next tutorial, _Audit a node for compliance_ ([Red Hat Enterprise Linux](/controls-for-compliance/rhel/)) ([Ubuntu](/controls-for-compliance/ubuntu/)), you'll learn how to write automated code that verifies a basic compliance policy. You'll also learn how to use Chef Analytics to monitor your audit rules so that the right people are notified when a compliance rule breaks in production. A version of this tutorial for Windows Server is coming soon.
