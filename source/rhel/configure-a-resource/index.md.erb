# Configure a resource

To get started, let's look at a basic configuration management project. You'll learn how to manage the Message of the Day (MOTD) file for your organization. A file is an example of a _resource_. A resource describes some piece of infrastructure, such as a file, a template, or a package.

## <i class="fa fa-linux" style="margin-right:3px;"></i> Get a Linux machine

In this tutorial, you'll configure the server directly. That's why it's important that you have a Linux machine available. In later tutorials, you'll manage RHEL or CentOS servers removely from whichever operating system you choose &ndash; be it Linux, Mac OS, or Windows.

There are two ways to get set up.

Option 1: use your own Linux machine. If you have a RHEL or CentOS machine that meets the [system requirements](http://docs.getchef.com/chef_system_requirements.html) that you'd like to use, install the [Chef Development Kit](http://www.getchef.com/downloads/chef-dk/) on it now.

Option 2: let us provide a CentOS virtual machine that has the Chef tools installed for you. Just click the button below.

## 1. Set up your working directory

If you're working from your own RHEL or CentOS machine, create the <codeinline>chef-repo</codeinline> directory under your home directory (if you're using a machine that we provided, this directory already exists.)

```bash
$ mkdir ~/chef-repo
```

Now <codeinline>cd</codeinline> there.

```bash
$ cd ~/chef-repo
```

## 2. Create the MOTD file

First, you need to create the file and set the initial MOTD. To keep things basic, let's configure the file in the working directory.

From your <codeinline>~/chef-repo</codeinline> directory, create a file named <filepath>hello.rb</filepath>, add these contents, and then save the file.

[COMMENT] If you don't have a preferred text editor, try <codeinline>Vim</codeinline>. This [interactive Vim tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html) tutorial can help you get oriented to the commands you'll need to create, edit, and save a file.

```ruby
# ~/chef-repo/hello.rb
file 'motd' do
  content 'hello world'
end
```

From your terminal window, run <codeinline>chef-apply</codeinline> to apply what you've written.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ chef-apply hello.rb
Recipe: (chef-apply cookbook)::(chef-apply recipe)
  * file[motd] action create
    - create new file motd
    - update content in file motd from none to de031d
        --- motd        2014-05-13 14:52:54.025253948 -0700
        +++ /tmp/.motd20140513-3474-5263n1 2014-05-13 14:52:54.025253948 -0700
        @@ -1 +1,2 @@
        +hello world
```

The output tells us that a new file, <filepath>motd</filepath>, was created.

Now verify that the file was written. Run the <codeinline>more</codeinline> command, which prints to the console the file you give it.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ more motd
hello world
```

### Run the command a second time

Now, let's see now what happens when you run the same command again.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ chef-apply hello.rb
Recipe: (chef-apply cookbook)::(chef-apply recipe)
  * file[motd] action create (up to date)
```

This time you get a different response. This is because Chef does work only when it needs to.

Chef looks at the current configuration state and applies the action only if the current state doesn't match the desired state. Here, Chef doesn't create or modify <filepath>motd</filepath> because it already exists and its contents didn't change.

## 3. Update the MOTD file's contents

Now you're going to change the MOTD.

Modify <filepath>hello.rb</filepath> like this ('hello world' becomes 'hello chef'.)

```ruby
# ~/chef-repo/hello.rb
file 'motd' do
  content 'hello chef'
end
```

Run <codeinline>chef-apply</codeinline>.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ chef-apply hello.rb
Recipe: (chef-apply cookbook)::(chef-apply recipe)
  * file[motd] action create
    - update content in file motd from de031d to b1522f
        --- motd        2014-05-13 14:52:54.025253948 -0700
        +++ /tmp/.motd20140513-4015-13xpiup  2014-05-13 15:00:07.284522132 -0700
        @@ -1,2 +1,2 @@
        -hello world
        +hello chef
```

This time Chef does work because we've changed the desired state of the file and need to update the installed version to match it.

## 4. Ensure the MOTD file's contents are not changed by anyone else

You need to make sure that no other process can change the MOTD.

Imagine that a co-worker manually changes <filepath>motd</filepath> by replacing 'hello chef' with 'hello robots'. Go ahead and change your copy through your text editor. Or you can change the file from the command line like this.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ echo 'hello robots' > motd
```

Now run <codeinline>chef-apply</codeinline>.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ chef-apply hello.rb
Recipe: (chef-apply cookbook)::(chef-apply recipe)
  * file[motd] action create
    - update content in file motd from 9b0c18 to b1522f
        --- motd        2014-05-13 15:03:47.638770524 -0700
        +++ /tmp/.motd20140513-4170-130uqxh  2014-05-13 15:04:43.874771326 -0700
        @@ -1,2 +1,2 @@
        -hello robots
        +hello chef
```

Chef restored the original configuration. This is actually a really good thing because Chef ensures that the actual state of your resource matches what you specify, even if it is altered by some outside process. Chef enables you to both apply a new configuration state as well as ensure that the current state stays how you want it.


## 5. Delete the MOTD file

OK, you're done experimenting with the MOTD, so let's clean up. From your working directory, create a new file named <filepath>goodbye.rb</filepath> and save this content to it.

```ruby
# goodbye.rb
file 'motd' do
  action :delete
end
```

Now apply <filepath>goodbye.rb</filepath> to delete the file.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ chef-apply goodbye.rb
Recipe: (chef-apply cookbook)::(chef-apply recipe)
  * file[motd] action delete
    - delete file motd
```

The output shows that <filepath>motd</filepath> is now gone, but let's prove it.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ more motd
motd: No such file or directory
```

## <i class="fa fa-question blueiconcolor" style="margin-right:3px;"></i> What did we see here?

You ran a few basic Chef commands and got a flavor of what Chef can do. You learned that a resource describes one part of the system and its desired state. You worked with a [file][file], which is one kind of resource.

### <i class="fa fa-cubes greeniconcolor" style="margin-right:3px;"></i> Resources describe the what, not the how

Your policy declares _what_ state each resource should be in, but not _how_ to get there. In this lesson, you declared that the file <filepath>motd</filepath> must exist and what its contents are, but you didn't specify how to apply that policy. This layer of abstraction can not only make you more productive, but it can also make your work more portable across platforms.

A recipe declares what state each resource should be in but not how to achieve that state. Chef handles these complexities for you.

### <i class="fa fa-bolt greeniconcolor" style="margin-right:3px;"></i> Resources have actions

When you deleted the file, you saw the <codeinline>delete</codeinline> action.

Think of an action as the process that achieves the desired configuration state. Every resource in Chef has a default action, and it's the most common affirmative one &ndash; for example, _create_ a file, _install_ a package, and _start_ a service.

When we created the file we didn't specify the <codeinline>create</codeinline> action because <codeinline>create</codeinline> is the default. But of course you can specify it if you want.

The documentation for each resource type, [file](<%= chef_docs_url %>/resource_file.html) for example, explains the type's default action.

### <i class="fa fa-file-text greeniconcolor" style="margin-right:3px;"></i> Recipes organize resources

In Chef, <filepath>hello.rb</filepath> is an example of a [recipe](<%= chef_docs_url %>/essentials_cookbook_recipes.html), or an ordered series of configuration states. A recipe typically contains related states, such as everything needed to configure a web server, database server, or a load balancer.

Our recipe states everything we need to manage the MOTD file. You used [chef-apply][chef-apply] to apply that recipe from the command line.

## <i class="fa fa-road blueiconcolor" style="margin-right:3px;"></i> What's next

Of course, your job is about more than just setting up files. Next you'll apply what you've learned to install and configure a package and service.
