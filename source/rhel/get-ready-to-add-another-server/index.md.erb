# Get ready to add another server

You learned how to use Chef to bring up a web server and serve a home page that displays some basic info about the server. You configured the server by running the commands directly on it, which is a great way to experiment with Chef.

But now you're ready to add a second server. You _could_ do this manually by installing the Chef tools, copying over your cookbooks, and running the Chef commands &ndash; all on the second server. But is there a better way?

_Chef server_ is a great place to serve as a central hub for your cookbooks. In this lesson you'll set up a Chef server and upload your cookbook to it. In the process, you'll also learn about <codeinline>knife</codeinline>, the tool that enables you to communicate with the Chef server.

If you haven't completed the [previous tutorial](/rhel/make-your-recipe-more-manageable/), we recommend that you do.

You'll need a computer ready to install the Chef tools on. If you're not ready to install it on your workstation, you can continue to use our [CentOS training lab](/rhel/get-a-virtual-machine/), which has the tools already installed.

  1. [Sign up for Hosted Enterprise Chef](#1signupforhostedenterprisechef)
  1. [Install the Starter Kit](#2installthestarterkit)

## 1. Sign up for Hosted Enterprise Chef

The easiest way to set up a Chef server is to let us host it for you on Hosted Enterprise Chef. To get set up, just fill out the form on our sign up page.

<a class='button radius' href='<%= hec_sign_up_url %>' target='_blank'>Sign up for a free trial of Hosted Enterprise Chef&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i></a>

Now you need to download some files that enable you to communicate with the Chef server.

## 2. Install the Starter Kit

The Starter Kit provides certificates and other files that enable you to securely communicate with the Chef server. Follow these steps from your workstation.

  1. Navigate to <%= link_to "#{hec_manage_url}", "#{hec_manage_url}", :target => "_blank" %> and sign in.
  1. From the **Administration** tab, choose the organization that you created when you signed up for Hosted Enterprise Chef.
  1. From the **Actions** column, select **Starter Kit**.
  1. Click the **Download Starter Kit** button.
  1. Click **Proceed**. Save the file <filepath>chef-starter.zip</filepath> to your computer.
  1. Extract <filepath>chef-starter.zip</filepath> to your working directory, <filepath>~/chef-repo</filepath>.

## 3. Upload your cookbook to the Chef server

Now let's upload our web server cookbook to the Chef server. From anywhere under your <filepath>chef-repo</filepath> directory, run this command.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ knife cookbook upload webserver
```

## <i class="fa fa-road blueiconcolor" style="margin-right:3px;"></i> Wrap-up and what's next

Great, you're all set up to use a Chef server. With your cookbook uploaded to the Chef server, you're now ready to scale-out your infrastructure!

The next step is to set up a second server to configure and run the cookbook on it.
