# <i class="fa fa-linux"></i> Get a virtual machine

You'll initially use Chef to configure the local system, so let's make sure that you're in an environment you're comfortable changing.

[CONCEPT] We provide a training lab to get you quick access to a working environment. Any RHEL or CentOS 6 machine with the [Chef Development Kit](http://www.getchef.com/downloads/chef-dk/) installed will work just as well. If you have access to an environment like this already and would prefer to use it, you can skip to the [next step](/rhel/configure-a-resource/).

Click the button below to access the CentOS Training Lab. It's a VM environment that's preconfigured with the Chef tools that you can access from your web browser.

Then follow these steps.

1. Fill in the form to register for CloudShare Enterprise.
1. Wait a few moments for CloudShare to provision the server. Click the **Start Using This Environment** button after it lights up.

1. Ensure you have command prompt open to the <filepath>~/chef-repo/</filepath> directory, either through the GUI or through SSH.

[CONCEPT] The environment will be available to you for 24 hours. Just fire up another one if it expires.

## Now try the first tutorial

You'll learn about configuring system resources, starting with files.
