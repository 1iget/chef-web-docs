# Set up your Chef environment

Before getting started using Chef, you'll need to set up your environment. Let's briefly touch on what the Chef environment looks like. 

The typical Chef environment is made up of 3 parts: the _Chef server_, your _workstation_, and _nodes_.

The _Chef server_ is the brains of the operation. It stores information about your infrastructure as well as reusable components called cookbooks. You can run Chef server on premesis or let us host it for you. More on that later.

A _workstation_ is where you will spend most of your time working with Chef. It's the same place you do your development or sysadmin work. From your workstation, you'll author Chef cookbooks, upload them to your Chef server, and more. 

A _node_ is a server in your infrastructure. Nodes are the computers that you manage using Chef. A node can be a physical computer, virtual machine, instance in your public or private cloud environment, or even a switch or router in your network.

Here's a visual representation to help you understand how the Chef server, workstation, and nodes fit together.

The next 3 sections walk you through the setup process. Each step has a few options. We recommend that as you evaluate and experiment with Chef that you choose the environment that you're most comfortable with. You can later adapt what you've learned to your business environment.

Expect to take about 20-30 minutes to work through the setup process.

## Step 1: Set up Chef server

Chef server comes in two flavors: <%= link_to 'Enterprise Chef', ec_sign_up_url, target: '_blank' %> and <%= link_to 'Open Source Chef', chef_install_url, target: '_blank' %>.

You can run Enterprise Chef either on premesis, or let us host it for you on Hosted Enterprise Chef. To help you experience Chef as quickly as possible, we recommend that you sign up for a free trial of Hosted Enterprise Chef. Just fill out the form on our sign up page. 

<%= link_to 'Sign up for a free trial of Hosted Enterprise Chef', hec_sign_up_url, class: 'button radius' %>


After you evaluate Chef, read [Which Chef is Right for You?](http://www.getchef.com/chef/#which-chef) to understand which version of Chef works best for your organization. You can also check out Joshua Timberman's [Chef 11 Server: Up and Running](http://www.getchef.com/blog/2013/03/11/chef-11-server-up-and-running/) blog post to get a feel for what it's like to set up Chef server yourself.

## Step 2: Set up your workstation

Chef supports administration from many flavors of Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and Unix. You can find all supported options [here](http://docs.opscode.com/chef_system_requirements.html#chef-client). To keep things manageable, we recommend that you start with one of these: 

  * Windows 7 or 8.1
  * Mac OS X 10.7.3+
  * Ubuntu 10.04 or 12.04

### Install the Starter Kit

During the Hosted Enterprise Chef signup process, you created an organization. Now you need to install the Starter Kit to enable your workstation to communicate with the Chef server (authenication is done through **.pem** certificates.)

1. Navigate to [manage.opscode.com/organizations](https://manage.opscode.com/organizations).
2. Choose your organization from the middle of the page.
3. Choose **Starter Kit** from the left of the page.
4. Click the **Download Starter Kit** button that appears.
5. Click **Proceed**. A folder named **chef-repo** will download to your computer.
6. Move **chef-repo** to a convenient location. For example, on Linux and Mac OS, you might move it to **home**, making the full path **/home/chef-repo**.

### Run the Chef installer

Chef provides everything you need to get started in what's called the [omnibus installer](http://docs.opscode.com/install_omnibus.html). The two important parts of the installation for a workstation are the Ruby programming language and **knife**, the command-line tool that provides the interface between the workstation and the Chef server. The installer includes other tools that we'll look at later.

Choose one of these options to install Chef on your workstation:

<% tabs do %>
  <% tab 'Windows', icon: 'windows' do %>
    <%= partial '/tutorials/set-up-your-chef-environment/_windows' %>
  <% end %>
  <% tab 'OS X', icon: 'apple' do %>
    <%= partial '/tutorials/set-up-your-chef-environment/_mac_linux' %>
  <% end %>
  <% tab 'Ubuntu', icon: 'layers' do %>
    <%= partial '/tutorials/set-up-your-chef-environment/_mac_linux' %>
  <% end %>
<% end # tabs %>

### Set up your text editor

Because you'll be writing code, be sure to set up a good text editor on your workstation. We recommend one that shows line numbers, provides syntax highlighting for Ruby, auto-completes commands, and enables you to work with multiple files at the same time. If you don't have a favorite text editor, you can try [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) for free. It works on all platforms.

## Step 3: Set up a node to manage

A node can be practically any computer with an operating system that is connected to a network and for which you have administrator, sudo, or root access. We recommend CentOS 6+, Windows Server 2008+, or Ubuntu 12.04+. You'll need access to the hostname or IP address of the server as well as the SSH username, password, and port.

### Deploy an image

Although you can use a physical machine, we recommend using a virtual machine so that you can easily spin up and tear down instances. We've provided a number of preconfigured images on Amazon EC2, and highly recommend that you start there. 

If you're a Vagrant user, the Enterprise Chef Starter Kit includes a Vagrantfile which can be used to launch a Vagrant instance. 

If you are not currently set up to use Vagrant or EC2, you can try our Chef Training Lab, (it's currently in beta - we'd love your <%= link_to "feedback", "feedback" %>.)

<% tabs do %>
  <% tab 'Amazon EC2' do %>
    <%= partial '/tutorials/set-up-your-chef-environment/ec2' %>
  <% end # tab %>
  <% tab 'Vagrant' do %>
    <%= partial '/tutorials/set-up-your-chef-environment/vagrant' %>
  <% end %>
  <% tab 'Chef Training Lab (Beta)' do %>
    <%= partial '/tutorials/set-up-your-chef-environment/cloud_share' %>
  <% end # tab %>
<% end # tabs %>

### Bootstrap the image

At this point, you have an image with a public IP address or hostname, can establish an SSH or RDP connection, and an administrator or root account that you can access.

Now you need to _bootstrap_ the image. The bootstrapping process installs the Chef client and checks in with the Chef server. 

#### Bootstrap a Windows node

If you're bootstrapping a Windows node, you'll first need to install the **knife windows** plugin on your workstation. The [documentation](http://docs.opscode.com/plugin_knife_windows.html) explains in detail how to do so, but on Linux the command typically looks like this:

```bash
/opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem install knife-windows
```

Then to bootstrap the Windows node, you run the **knife bootstrap** command. Bootstrapping a Windows Server image on EC2 looks like this:

```
knife bootstrap windows winrm ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com -x chef â€“P chef -N node1
```

If you're not using an EC2 image, replace **ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com** with your node's IP address or hostname, and the **-x** and **-P** arguments with the username and password for an account that has administrator access.

The **-N** argument specifies the node's name. It can be whatever you like.

#### Bootstrap a Linux node

If you're bootstrapping a Linux node, navigate to the **chef-repo** directory and run the **knife bootstrap** command. Bootstrapping a Linux image on EC2 looks like this:
 
```bash
knife bootstrap ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com --sudo -x chef -P chef -N node1
```

If you're not using an EC2 image, replace **ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com** with your node's IP address or hostname, and the **-x** and **-P** arguments with the username and password for an account that has administrator access.

The **-N** argument specifies the node's name. It can be whatever you like.

You'll be prompted to re-enter the sudo password.

#### Verify the node

To verify that the node is bootstrapped, navigate to [manage.opscode.com/organizations](https://manage.opscode.com/organizations). From the **Nodes** tab, you'll see an entry for the node you just bootstrapped.

When logged into your account and the organization used for this tutorial series, you should see a single node listed on the **Nodes** tab.

## All done!

Congratulations! You're now set up with your Chef environment and are ready to start the first tutorial where you'll write your first cookbook.
