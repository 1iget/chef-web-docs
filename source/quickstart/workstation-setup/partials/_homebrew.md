###### homebrew
Homebrew is "the missing package manager for OS X". We will use homebrew to install a Ruby version manager and a Ruby builder. You could also use homebrew to install Ruby for you, but that's not recommended at this time.

Installing homebrew is just a single command.

    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
