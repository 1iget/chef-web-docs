# The Chef Server

The Chef Server is the brains of the operation. It stores configuration data and re-usable templates ("Cookbooks"), enables complex automation tasks through the use of search, and tracks the results of Chef's actions across your environment.

The best way for new Chef users to set up a Chef Server is to sign up for a free trial of Hosted Enterprise Chef.*

The Organization included in the trial is the Chef Server you will use for the exercises on Learn Chef.

[INFO] Later on, if you would prefer to install and maintain your own Chef Server locally, you can do so with either <%= link_to 'Enterprise Chef', ec_sign_up_url %> or the <%= link_to 'Open Source Chef Server', chef_install_url %>.

If you have not done so already, follow these two steps:

## Sign Up

<%= link_to 'Sign up for a free trial of Hosted Enterprise Chef', hec_sign_up_url %> by filling out the form on our sign up page (see below).

<%= image_tag 'quickstart/chef-server/sign-up-screen.png' %>

STEP 1B: Download and Extract the Starter Kit
After completing the form pictured above, you will be taken to a landing page within the Hosted Enterprise Chef web UI (see picture below). Perform the following... 
Click the "Starter Kit" link on the left. 
Extract the Starter Kit into your home directory. (It will extract as “chef-repo”, more on that later).
