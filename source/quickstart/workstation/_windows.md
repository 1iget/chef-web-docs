The first step in setting up your workstation is to install the Chef Client locally. This will install both Chef as well as a compatible version of Ruby on your system.

Go to the [Chef Client download page](http://www.getchef.com/chef/install/), select the appropriate options, and download the Chef Client MSI installer.

Run the Windows Chef Installer, accepting the default options.
