# Chef Quick Start Guide

The Quick Start is designed to be the ideal place for new Chef users to begin working with Chef.

There are three core components of Chef:

<% current_page.children.each do |child| %>
  * <%= link_to child.data['title'], child %>: <%= child.data['description'] %>
<% end %>

Our Quick Start guide walks you through each of these in a series of clear steps.  If you follow this guide exactly, it should take no more than 20 minutes to be completely set up with Chef.

<%= link_to "Proceed to Step One: #{current_page.children.first.data['title']} &rarr;", current_page.children.first %>
