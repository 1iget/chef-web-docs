A _driver_ specifies the software that interacts with the machine. There are a number of [popular drivers](https://docs.chef.io/kitchen.html#drivers), and in this tutorial we showed you three &ndash; EC2, Hyper-V, and Vagrant.

The choice of which driver to use depends on a number of factors, including:

* what operating system you use for your workstation.
* whether your workstation supports virtualization.
* whether you run your infrastructure in the cloud.
* what testing and verifications methods your team currently uses.
