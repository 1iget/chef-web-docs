In this part, you'll set up your workstation to run Windows Server through the Test Kitchen Hyper-V driver.

To use the Hyper-V driver, you first create a _base_, or parent, virtual machine that's set to some standard configuration. When Test Kitchen runs, it first creates a _child_ instance by loading the base configuration into a new virtual machine instance. Then Test Kitchen applies your cookbooks to the child instance. The Hyper-V driver creates a [differencing disk](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc720381.aspx) that captures what changes are made to the child instance. A differencing disk enables the parent disk to remain unmodified, and helps keep the size of Test Kitchen child instances smaller.

In this lesson, you'll configure a base virtual machine to run Windows Server 2012 R2 that can perform common tasks such as accept remote WinRM connections and access the Internet. You'll use this base virtual machine in the next lesson.

Although it can take some time to set up the base image, you only have to do this one time. Once you have a base virtual machine set up, you can reuse it as many times as you need as you develop and test your cookbooks.

[COMMENT] In this lesson, you'll run PowerShell commands from your workstation. Ensure that you run PowerShell as `Administrator`.
