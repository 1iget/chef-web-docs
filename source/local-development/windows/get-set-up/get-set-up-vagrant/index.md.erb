In this part, you'll set up your workstation to run Windows Server as a virtual machine through Test Kitchen.

The setup process involves downloading the evaluation version of Windows Server 2012 R2 as an ISO image and running a [Packer](https://packer.io/) template to convert the ISO image to a format that Vagrant and VirtualBox can use. The Packer template can take several hours to finish. However, you don't need to be present while it runs.
