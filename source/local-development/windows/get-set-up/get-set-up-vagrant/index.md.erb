In this part, you'll set up your workstation to run Windows Server as a virtual machine through Test Kitchen.

[TIP] This page explains the manual steps to help you understand exactly what software you need to install and how to install it. You can also run the [ChefDK_Bootstrap](https://github.com/Nordstrom/chefdk_bootstrap) script to setup your Windows or Mac workstation for Chef development. The script installs [commonly used development tools](https://github.com/Nordstrom/chefdk_bootstrap#what-does-it-do) such as the Atom text editor, Git, VirtualBox, and Vagrant. After you run the script, you can continue to [step 3](#step3) to install the remaining tools.

The setup process involves downloading the evaluation version of Windows Server 2012 R2 as an ISO image and running a [Packer](https://packer.io/) template to convert the ISO image to a format that Vagrant and VirtualBox can use. The Packer template can take several hours to finish. However, you don't need to be present while it runs.
