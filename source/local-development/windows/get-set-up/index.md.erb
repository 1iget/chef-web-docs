Here you'll make sure that your workstation is set up for Chef development. You'll also set up your environment to work with either Amazon EC2 instances or local virtual machines on your workstation.

## 1. Set up your workstation for Chef development

Although this tutorial doesn't involve the Chef server or bootstrapping a node, we recommend that you complete [Manage a Windows Server node](/manage-a-node/windows/) before starting this tutorial.

If you prefer to learn about local development now, before learning how to bootstrap a node, [perform these steps](/manage-a-node/windows/get-set-up/) to set up your workstation. Then come back to this page.

At this point, your workstation should:

* have the latest version of the Chef Development Kit.
* have a programmer's text editor that you're comfortable working with.
* have the <code class="file-path">~/learn-chef</code> directory for you to work in.

## 2. Set up your Test Kitchen environment for local development

Test Kitchen works with virtualization and cloud providers to create temporary instances to test your infrastructure code. We often call the software that connects Test Kitchen to the provider a _driver_.

In this tutorial, you'll have the option to use the [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [Hyper-V](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/dd448604.aspx), or [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) driver to manage temporary virtual machines.

The choice of which driver to use depends on a number of factors, including:

* what operating system you use for your workstation.
* whether your workstation supports OS virtualization.
* whether you run your infrastructure in the cloud.
* what testing and verifications methods your team currently uses.

For both the Hyper-V and Vagrant options, we recommend that your workstation have 50 GB of free disk space and 8 GB total memory; your workstation must also be configured to use CPU virtualization.

[COMMENT] With some modification, you can use one of the other [popular drivers](https://docs.chef.io/kitchen.html#drivers). When we show you how to set up your Test Kitchen configuration file, refer to that driver's documentation to learn how to modify your configuration file.

### Option 1: Test Kitchen and EC2

This option uses [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) to manage virtual machine instances in the cloud.

Choose this option if you prefer to work with cloud instances or your workstation's hardware doesn't support virtual machines. Hourly billing for any machine resources that you use is done through your AWS account.

(AWS's [one-year free account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_US&sc_publisher=google&sc_medium=cloud_computing_b&sc_content=aws_free_e&sc_detail=aws%20free%20tier&sc_category=cloud_computing&sc_segment=73823473242&sc_matchtype=e&sc_country=US&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!73823473242!e!!g!!aws%20free%20tier&ef_id=VV3lAgAAAHK07c0y:20151119221840:s) gives you 750 hours per month of usage on the t2.micro tier.)

### Option 2: Test Kitchen and Hyper-V

This option uses [Hyper-V](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/dd448604.aspx) to manage virtual machine instances on your workstation.

Choose this option if you're using a Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 workstation, [your workstation can run Hyper-V](https://msdn.microsoft.com/virtualization/hyperv_on_windows/quick_start/walkthrough_compatibility), and you'd rather work with local virtual machines than with cloud instances. This option can take longer to set up than the EC2 option because you need to download and set up a base Windows Server image.

### Option 3: Test Kitchen and Vagrant

This option uses the virtualization tools [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) to manage virtual machine instances on your workstation.

Choose this option if you're using a Windows 7, Linux, or Mac OS workstation and you'd rather work with local virtual machines than with cloud instances. Like the Hyper-V option, you'll need to build your own Windows Server base image. This option typically takes the longest to complete.
