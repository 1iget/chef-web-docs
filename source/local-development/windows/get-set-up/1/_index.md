[COMMENT] The [Chef documentation](https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html) describes additional steps that can help you set up your workstation to use Chef more effectively. You don't have to perform all the steps now, but you can refer to it later if you run into problems. For example, if you're running multiple versions of Ruby, the documentation explains [how to use Chef's Ruby](https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html#set-system-ruby).
