Local development gives you the time and flexibility to experiment, iterate, and fix problems early in the development cycle. You only upload your cookbooks to the Chef server and apply them to your bootstrapped node after you've confirmed from your workstation that your configuration code works as you expect.

In the next tutorial, [Learn to manage a basic Windows Server web application](/manage-a-web-app/windows/), you'll use the skills you've just learned to build a basic but complete web application that uses a web server, a database, and scripting. You'll learn how to leverage cookbooks that are written by the Chef community and resolve cookbook dependencies to create cookbooks that are more reusable.
