You can think of a Test Kitchen _driver_ like you would a printer or graphics driver. A driver connects Test Kitchen to the underlying virtualization provider. There are a number of [popular drivers](https://docs.chef.io/kitchen.html#drivers), and in this tutorial we showed you three &ndash; EC2, Hyper-V, and Vagrant.

Drivers work by calling into the virtualization provider's programming interface or command-line tools. For example, the EC2 driver uses the [AWS SDK for Ruby](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/) to create, communicate with, and destroy cloud  instances.

The choice of which driver to use depends on a number of factors, including:

* what operating system you use for your workstation.
* whether your workstation supports virtualization.
* whether you run your infrastructure in the cloud.
* what testing and verifications methods your team currently uses.
