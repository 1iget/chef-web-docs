Local development with Test Kitchen:

* enables you to use a variety of virtualization providers that create virtual machine or container instances locally on your workstation or in the cloud.
* enables you to run your cookbooks on servers that resemble those that you use in production.
* speeds up the development cycle by automatically provisioning and tearing down temporary instances, resolving cookbook dependencies, and applying your cookbooks to your instances.
