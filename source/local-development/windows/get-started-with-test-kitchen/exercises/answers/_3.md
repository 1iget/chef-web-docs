As you develop your cookbooks, you might need to ensure that your configuration behaves like you expect in more than one environment.

You've already applied the `settings_windows` cookbook in one environment by defining the driver configuration at the root level of your <code class="file-path">.kitchen.yml</code> file.

To apply your cookbook in multiple environments &ndash; say Hyper-V and EC2 &ndash; start by modifying <code class="file-path">.kitchen.yml</code> to look like this.

```yaml
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/settings_windows/.kitchen.yml
---
provisioner:
  name: chef_zero

platforms:
  - name: windows-2012r2
  - name: windows-2012r2-ec2

suites:
  - name: default
    run_list:
      - recipe[settings_windows::default]
    attributes:
```

This version removes the `driver` section and adds a second entry to the `platforms` section.

Now add a `driver` section for each platform.

```yaml
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/settings_windows/.kitchen.yml
---
provisioner:
  name: chef_zero

platforms:
  - name: windows-2012r2
    driver:
      name: hyperv
      parent_vhd_folder: C:\Hyper-V
      parent_vhd_name: WindowsServer2012R2.vhdx
      vm_switch: ExternalSwitch
      memory_startup_bytes: 2GB
    transport:
      password: H24?6;H.QaV8JP2&
  - name: windows-2012r2-ec2
    driver:
      name: ec2
      aws_ssh_key_id: learnchef
      region: us-west-2
      availability_zone: a
      subnet_id: subnet-eacb348f
      instance_type: m1.small
      image_id: ami-4dbcb67d
      security_group_ids: ['sg-2d3b3b48']
      retryable_tries: 120
    transport:
      ssh_key: C:\Users\LearnChef\.ssh\learnchef.pem

suites:
  - name: default
    run_list:
      - recipe[settings_windows::default]
    attributes:
```

The first platform is named `windows-2012r2` and applies your configuration locally through Hyper-V.  For the Hyper-V configuration, replace the value for `password` with the `Administrator` password on your base virtual machine.

The second platform is named `windows-2012r2-ec2` and applies your configuration on an EC2 instance. For the EC2 configuration, replace the values for `aws_ssh_key_id`, `region`, `availability_zone`, `subnet_id`, `image_id`, `security_group_ids`, and `ssh_key` with your values.

Now run `kitchen list` to see the matrix of test instances that are available. Here, we have two platforms &ndash; `windows-2012r2` and `windows-2012r2-ec2` &ndash; multiplied by one suite &ndash; `default`.

```ps
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/settings_windows
$ kitchen list
Instance                    Driver   Provisioner  Verifier  Transport  Last Action
default-windows-2012r2      Vagrant  ChefZero     Busser    Winrm      <Not Created>
default-windows-2012r2-ec2  Ec2      ChefZero     Busser    Winrm      <Not Created>
```

Run `kitchen converge` to create the instances and apply the `settings_windows` cookbook.

```ps
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/settings_windows

You can now connect to your instances to verify that everything's working. You can connect to your Hyper-V instance from Hyper-V Manager. To connect to your EC2 instance, you can run `kitchen login`. But this time, you need to provide the instance name so that Test Kitchen knows which instance to connect to.

```ps
# ~\settings_windows
$ kitchen login default-windows-2012r2-ec2
```

When you're done working with your instances, run `kitchen destroy` to delete them.
