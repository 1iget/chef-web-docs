Here you'll make sure that your workstation is set up for Chef development and also install the virtualization software.

[TIP] This page explains the manual steps to help you understand exactly what software you need to install and how to install it. Alternatively, you can also run the [ChefDK_Bootstrap](https://github.com/Nordstrom/chefdk_bootstrap) script to set up your Windows or Mac workstation for Chef development. The script installs [commonly used development tools](https://github.com/Nordstrom/chefdk_bootstrap#what-does-it-do) such as the Atom text editor, Git, VirtualBox, and Vagrant.

## Before you begin

This tutorial uses VirtualBox and Vagrant to manage test instances. This option is popular with Chef users because it uses free software and is easy to set up.

Your workstation &ndash; the system from which you develop your cookbooks &ndash; can be a physical machine or a virtual machine that supports nested virtualization. 

Ensure that your workstation supports and is configured to use CPU virtualization. This setting is typically configured through your system's BIOS. If you're using a virtual machine as your workstation through a program such as VMware Fusion, [ensure that nested virtualization is enabled](https://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-8970) on the workstation VM.

Also ensure that your workstation meets the [system requirements](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/End-user_documentation) for running VirtualBox. 

VirtualBox does not run in virtualized workstation environments such as Amazon EC2 or a VirtualBox host instance. With some modification, you can [use another Test Kitchen driver](https://docs.chef.io/kitchen.html#drivers) if you're unable to run VirtualBox.

## 1. Set up your workstation for Chef development

Although this tutorial doesn't involve the Chef server or bootstrapping a node, we recommend that you complete [Manage a Red Hat Enterprise Linux node](/manage-a-node/rhel/) before starting this tutorial.

If you prefer to learn about local development now, before learning how to bootstrap a node, [perform these steps](/manage-a-node/rhel/get-set-up/) to set up your workstation. Then come back to this page.

At this point, your workstation should:

* have the latest version of the Chef Development Kit.
* have a programmer's text editor that you're comfortable working with.
* have the <code class="file-path">~/learn-chef</code> directory for you to work in.
* have an SSH client &ndash; we recommend installing Git if you're using a Windows workstation.

Having an SSH client is important because you'll log in to your Linux instance to verify your work.

## 2. Install VirtualBox

Install VirtualBox. VirtualBox manages your virtual machine instances.

## 3. Install Vagrant

Next, install Vagrant. Test Kitchen uses Vagrant to communicate with VirtualBox and to configure aspects of the virtual machine such as available memory, host name, and network settings.
