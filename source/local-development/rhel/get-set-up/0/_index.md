## Before you begin

Ensure that your workstation supports and is configured to use CPU virtualization. If you're using a virtual machine as your workstation through a program such as VMWare Fusion, ensure that virtualization is enabled on the virtual machine.

Also ensure that your workstation meets the [system requirements](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/End-user_documentation) requirements for running VirtualBox.
