## 4. Windows only &ndash; install Git

Only complete this step if you're using Windows as your workstation.

In this tutorial, you'll log in to your Linux instance to verify your work. To do so, you'll need an SSH client. Mac OS and most Linux distributions come with an SSH client. On Windows, you'll need to install one manually.

The easiest way to get set up is to install Git, which includes an SSH client.

After you install Git, ensure that the path to the Git binaries are included in your system `PATH`, for example <code class="file-path">C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\bin</code>.

[FEEDBACK] We're looking for feedback on this requirement. Is Git part of your existing workflow? Would you rather be able to configure your own SSH client? Should we provide an SSH client in the Chef DK?
