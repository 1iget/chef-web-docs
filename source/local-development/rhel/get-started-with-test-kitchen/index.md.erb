In this lesson, you'll run through the Test Kitchen workflow to get the hang of things.

    <td>In this step, you manually verify that your virtual environment is configured as you expect.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/assets/images/misc/local_dev_destroy.png" style="display: inline; width: 125px; box-shadow: none;" alt=""/></td>
    <td>In this step, Test Kitchen shuts down and destroys your virtual environment.</td>

Here, we'll create a cookbook that configures the Message of the Day (MOTD) file on a CentOS virtual machine, apply that cookbook on the virtual machine, verify that everything's working, and finally destroy the instance.
