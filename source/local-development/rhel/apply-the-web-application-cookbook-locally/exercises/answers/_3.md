Your `motd` cookbook is already configured to work on Ubuntu 14.04 as well as CentOS 6.6, so you don't need to modify it.

To run it on Ubuntu 14.04, add an entry to the `platforms` section of your <code class="file-path">.kitchen.yml</code> file like this.

```ruby
# ~/motd/.kitchen.yml
---
driver:
  name: vagrant

provisioner:
  name: chef_zero

platforms:
  - name: ubuntu-14.04
  - name: centos-6.6

suites:
  - name: default
    run_list:
      - recipe[motd::default]
    attributes:
```

Run `kitchen list` to see the matrix of test instances that are available. Here, we have two platforms &ndash; Ubuntu 14.04 and CentOS 6.6 &ndash; multiplied by one suite &ndash; `default`.

```bash
# ~/motd
$ kitchen list
Instance             Driver   Provisioner  Verifier  Transport  Last Action
default-ubuntu-1404  Vagrant  ChefZero     Busser    Ssh        <Not Created>
default-centos-66    Vagrant  ChefZero     Busser    Ssh        <Not Created>
```

Run `kitchen converge` to create the instances and apply the `motd` cookbook.

```bash
# ~/motd
$ kitchen converge
-----> Starting Kitchen (v1.4.0)
-----> Creating <default-ubuntu-1404>...
       Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
[...]
       Running handlers:
       Running handlers complete
       Chef Client finished, 1/1 resources updated in 10.372334751 seconds
       Finished converging <default-ubuntu-1404> (3m52.59s).
-----> Creating <default-centos-66>...
       Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...

       Running handlers:
       Running handlers complete
       Chef Client finished, 1/1 resources updated in 5.32753132 seconds
       Finished converging <default-centos-66> (10m12.63s).
-----> Kitchen is finished. (19m47.71s)
```

Now to confirm that everything's working, run `kitchen login`. But this time, you need to provide the instance name so that Test Kitchen knows which instance to connect to.

```bash
# ~/motd
$ kitchen login default-centos-66
Last login: Fri May  8 22:34:39 2015 from 10.0.2.2

$ exit

```
