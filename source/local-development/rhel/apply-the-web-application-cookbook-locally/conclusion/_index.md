In this tutorial, you used Test Kitchen along with VirtualBox and Vagrant to configure your customers web application on a CentOS virtual machine, all from your workstation.

Local development gives you the time and flexibility to experiment, iterate, and fix problems early in the development cycle. You only upload your cookbooks to the Chef server and apply them to your bootstrapped node after you've confirmed from your workstation that your configuration code works as you expect.

Stay tuned for the next tutorial, where we'll show you how to speed up the feedback loop even more by writing test code that automatically verifies whether your policy behaves as you expect. In the meantime, check out the [Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci) site to learn more.
