Here you'll set up the virtualization software and install the Chef DK if you don't have it.

[TIP] This page explains the manual steps to help you understand exactly what software you need to install and how to install it. Alternatively, you can also run the [ChefDK_Bootstrap](https://github.com/Nordstrom/chefdk_bootstrap) script to setup your Windows or Mac workstation for Chef development. The script installs [commonly used development tools](https://github.com/Nordstrom/chefdk_bootstrap#what-does-it-do) such as the Atom text editor, Git, VirtualBox, and Vagrant.
