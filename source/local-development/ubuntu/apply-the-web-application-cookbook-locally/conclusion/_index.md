In this tutorial, you used Test Kitchen along with VirtualBox and Vagrant to configure your customers web application on an Ubuntu virtual machine, all from your workstation.

When you start by developing locally, you speed up the development cycle, giving you the time and freedom to experiment, iterate, and fix problems. Now you only need to upload your cookbooks to the Chef server and apply them to your bootstrapped node after you've confirmed from your workstation that your configuration code works as you expect.

Stay tuned for the next tutorial, where we'll show you how to speed up the feedback loop even more by writing test code that automatically verifies whether your policy behaves as you expect. In the meantime, check out the [Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci) site to learn more.

Also check out the [Chef Fundamentals Series](/fundamentals-series/), where Technical Community Director Nathen Harvey covers the fundamentals of using Chef in a 6-part video series.
