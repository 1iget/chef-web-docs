[Last time](/getting-started/rhel/configure-a-package-and-service/) you learned how to manage a package and a service by configuring a web server. You also added a basic web page. But there was one problem &ndash; although it helped you verify that your web server was properly configured, the code for your HTML page was embedded in the Chef recipe.

Let's create a _cookbook_ to make our web server recipe easier to manage. A cookbook provides structure to your recipes and enables you to more easily reference external files, such as our web server's home page. In essence, a cookbook helps you stay organized.

Like the previous lessons, you'll configure the server directly. You can continue with the Linux machine you used in the previous lesson, but let's review the options.

Option 1: Use your own RHEL or CentOS machine. If you have a machine you'd like to use that meets the [system requirements](<%= chef_docs_url %>/chef_system_requirements.html), install the [Chef Development Kit](<%= chef_dk_url %>) on it now.

Option 2: Let us provide a CentOS virtual machine with the Chef tools installed for you. Just click the button below.

## 1. Create a cookbook

First, from your <code class="file-path">~/chef-repo</code> directory, create a <code class="file-path">cookbooks</code> directory and `cd` there.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ mkdir cookbooks
$ cd cookbooks
```

Now run the `chef` command to generate a cookbook named **learn\_chef\_httpd**.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo/cookbooks
$ chef generate cookbook learn_chef_httpd
```

Here's the directory structure that the command created.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo/cookbooks
$ tree
.
└── learn_chef_httpd
    ├── Berksfile
    ├── chefignore
    ├── metadata.rb
    ├── README.md
    └── recipes
        └── default.rb

2 directories, 5 files
```

Note the default recipe, named <code class="file-path">default.rb</code>. This is where we'll move our Apache recipe in a moment.
