Now let's start the IIS World Wide Web Publishing Service (W3SVC) and enable it when the server boots. Modify <code class="file-path">webserver.rb</code> to look like this.

```ruby-Win32
# ~\chef-repo\webserver.rb
powershell_script 'Install IIS' do
  code 'Add-WindowsFeature Web-Server'
  guard_interpreter :powershell_script
  not_if "(Get-WindowsFeature -Name Web-Server).Installed"
end

service 'w3svc' do
  action [:start, :enable]
end
```

This code uses a list to declare multiple actions.

Now apply it.

```ps
# ~\chef-repo
$ chef-apply webserver.rb
Recipe: (chef-apply cookbook)::(chef-apply recipe)
  * powershell_script[Install IIS] action run (skipped due to not_if)
  * service[w3svc] action start (up to date)
  * service[w3svc] action enable (up to date)
```

IIS is already installed, so again there's nothing to do. Similarly, the W3SVC service is already started and enabled. The command would install IIS if it got uninstalled and enable the W3SVC service if it was stopped or disabled.
