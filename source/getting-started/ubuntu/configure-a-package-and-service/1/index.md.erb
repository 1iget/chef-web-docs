Let's extend what you learned about file management in the [previous lesson](/ubuntu/configure-a-resource/) to manage the Apache HTTP Server package and its service. Like files, packages and services are also types of resources.

Of course, you can set up one web server manually. But with Chef it'll be easier to manage your infrastructure as you scale, add complexity, and roll out new configuration policies.

Although you don't need prior knowledge about web servers, configuring one is a great way to grow your Chef skills.

Like the previous lesson, you'll configure the server directly. You can continue with the Linux machine you used in the previous lesson, but let's review the options.

Option 1: Use your own Ubuntu machine. If you have a machine you'd like to use that meets the [system requirements](<%= chef_docs_url %>/chef_system_requirements.html), install the [Chef Development Kit](<%= chef_downloads_url %>/chef-dk/) on it now.

Option 2: Let us provide an Ubuntu virtual machine with the Chef tools installed for you. Just click the button below.

## 1. Install the Apache package

Let's install the Apache package, **apache2**. From your <code class="file-path">~/chef-repo</code> directory, add this recipe to a file named <code class="file-path">webserver.rb</code>.

```ruby
# ~/chef-repo/webserver.rb
package 'apache2'
```

We don't need to specify an action because `install` is the default.

Now run `chef-apply` to apply the recipe.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ sudo chef-apply webserver.rb
Recipe: (chef-apply cookbook)::(chef-apply recipe)
  * package[apache2] action install
    - install version 2.4.6-2ubuntu2.2 of package apache2
```

[COMMENT] `sudo` is required because this command installs a package and therefore must be run with root privileges. If you're running as root on your own machine, you can omit `sudo` from the command.

Run the recipe a second time.

```bash
# ~/chef-repo
$ sudo chef-apply webserver.rb
Recipe: (chef-apply cookbook)::(chef-apply recipe)
  * package[apache2] action install (up to date)
  ```

You see that Chef does no work because there's nothing to do &ndash; the package is already installed.
