## 3. Get a hosted Chef account

You'll store your cookbooks on a Chef server so that your node can access them. Hosted Chef is the easiest way to work through this tutorial. We recommend you work through [Learn to manage a Windows Server node](/manage-a-node/windows/) if you do not have a hosted Chef account that you can access from your workstation.

[COMMENT] If your organization is [running its own Chef server](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-server/) and you know how to work with it, you can use that Chef server instead of setting up a hosted Chef account.
