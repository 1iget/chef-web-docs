This tutorial builds on the previous tutorial, [Get started with Test Kitchen](/tutorials/local-development/windows/), and has the same requirements. We recommend you work through the previous tutorial before starting this one.

[COMMENT] Remember, although you're configuring Windows Server, your workstation can be any OS you choose &ndash; be it Windows, Mac OS, or Linux. Your workstation can also be a virtual machine that's running on VMware Fusion or another hypervisor that enables nested virtualization.

At this point, your workstation should:

* have the latest version of the Chef DK.
* have a programmer's text editor that you're comfortable working with.
* have the <% fp('~/learn-chef') %> directory for you to work in.
* be set up to work with Windows Server instances through Test Kitchen.

The [Get started with Test Kitchen](/tutorials/local-development/windows/) tutorial, which is prerequisite to this one, shows three ways to work with Windows Server instances &ndash; EC2, Hyper-V, and Vagrant with VirtualBox. You can also [choose one of the other drivers](https://docs.chef.io/config_yml_kitchen.html#drivers) if you prefer. The choice you make depends on which operating system you use for your workstation and how you prefer to work with Windows Server test instances.
