Now that you have the Customers web application working on a local test instance through Test Kitchen, you can apply your `awesome_customers_windows` cookbook to a real server, or node.

This part is optional, but it's a good opportunity to practice uploading your cookbooks to Chef server and then applying them to a bootstrapped node. In the process, you'll also learn how to use Berkshelf to automatically identify and resolve dependencies that your cookbook has on other cookbooks.

You'll need to [set up a Chef server account](/manage-a-node/windows/set-up-your-chef-server/) if you don't already have one.

Here are the steps you'll follow:

1. [Bring up a node to manage](#step1)
1. [Copy your secret key to your node](#step2)
1. [Upload your encrypted data bag to Chef server](#step3)
1. [Upload your cookbooks to Chef server](#step4)
1. [Bootstrap your node](#step5)
1. [Verify the configuration](#step6)
1. [Optionally, clean up your environment](#cleanupyourenvironment)

[START_BOX]

## 1. Bring up a node to manage

Like you did in [Learn to manage a node](/manage-a-node/windows/), bring up a Windows Server 2012 R2 server to manage. Your server can run on spare hardware, a cloud instance, or even a virtual machine.

[Read this page](/manage-a-node/windows/get-a-node-to-bootstrap/) if you need a refresher on how to prepare your node for the bootstrap process.

At this point, your node should have ports 80, 443, 3389, and 5986 open through the firewall. You should have also verified that you can establish an SSL connection to your node using the `knife wsman test` command. You also need your node's host name or public IP address, as well as an account that has Administrator access and its password.

## 2. Copy your secret key to your node

Your node will need the secret key in order to decrypt the data bag item that contains your database passwords. In this step you'll copy the secret key to the <% fp 'C:/chef' %> directory on your node.

Recall that you created a custom node attribute that holds the location of the secret file on your node.

```ruby
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/awesome_customers_windows/attributes/default.rb
# [...]
default['awesome_customers_windows']['secret_file'] = 'C:/chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret'
# [...]
```

For learning purposes, the easiest way to copy the secret is over an RDP connection. Start by creating an RDP connection to your node and then create the <% fp 'C:/chef' %> directory on your node.

From a Windows workstation, copy <% fp '~/learn-chef/.chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret' %> from a File Explorer window and paste it in the <% fp 'C:/chef' %> directory on your node.

If you're using a Mac OS or Linux workstation, you can open <% fp '~/learn-chef/.chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret' %> in a text editor, copy its contents, and then paste its contents to <% fp 'C:\chef\encrypted_data_bag_secret' %> on your server. 

In a production environment, it's up to you to decide the best way to distribute secret keys to your nodes.

## 3. Upload your encrypted data bag to Chef server

When you created your encrypted data bag item to store your database passwords, you did so locally on your workstation.

To upload your data bag items to Chef server, you run similar `knife` commands, except that you omit the `--local-mode` and `--secret-file` arguments.

The first step is to create the data bag object on your Chef server. You need to give the data bag the same name as the directory that stores the data bag item on your workstation. In our case, the name is `database_passwords`.

From the <% fp '~/learn-chef' %> directory, run the following `knife data bag create` command to create the data bag object on your Chef server.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ knife data bag create database_passwords
Created data_bag[database_passwords]
```

Now run the following `knife data bag from file` command to upload your data bag item to Chef server.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ knife data bag from file database_passwords sql_server_customers.json
Updated data_bag_item[database_passwords::sql_server_customers]
```

You omit the `--secret-file` argument because the data bag item is already in an encrypted format.

## 4. Upload your cookbooks to Chef server

Recall that <code class="file-path">metadata.rb</code> references the cookbooks your cookbook depends on.

```ruby
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/awesome_customers_windows/metadata.rb
name 'awesome_customers_windows'
maintainer 'The Authors'
maintainer_email 'you@example.com'
license 'all_rights'
description 'Installs/Configures awesome_customers_windows'
long_description 'Installs/Configures awesome_customers_windows'
version '0.1.0'

depends 'sql_server', '~> 2.5.0'
depends 'iis', '~> 4.1.6'
```

These cookbooks need to exist on the Chef server so that the node can access them when it runs `chef-client`.

You could download each cookbook from Chef Supermarket and then upload it the Chef server, but there's one minor complication &ndash; each cookbook you depend on might depend on one or more other cookbooks. And those cookbooks in turn might depend on others.

For example, if you [look at the iis](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/iis/blob/master/metadata.rb) cookbook, you'll see in its <code class="file-path">metadata.rb</code> file that it depends on the `windows` cookbook.

```ruby
# metadata.rb
# [...]
supports 'windows'
depends 'windows', '>= 1.34.6'
source_url 'https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/iis' if respond_to?(:source_url)
issues_url 'https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/iis/issues' if respond_to?(:issues_url)
```

To help unravel this dependency web &ndash; and remove the need for you to manually resolve cookbook dependencies &ndash; we're going to use [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com) instead of running the `knife cookbook upload` command to manually upload each dependency. Berkshelf uploads your cookbooks to the Chef server and retrieves the cookbooks that your cookbook depends on.

Berkshelf comes with the Chef DK, so you don't have to install anything.

When you created your cookbook, the `chef generate cookbook` command created a file named <code class="file-path">Berksfile</code> in the cookbook's root directory.

For this project, you won't need to work directly with <code class="file-path">Berksfile</code>. But you'll notice that <code class="file-path">Berksfile</code> comes pre-configured to pull cookbooks from Chef Supermarket.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/awesome_customers_windows
$ more Berksfile
source "https://supermarket.chef.io"

metadata
```

The `metadata` line tells Berkshelf to pull additional dependencies from the <code class="file-path">metadata.rb</code> file.

### Use Berkshelf to install your dependencies

The next step is to have Berkshelf resolve your dependencies by downloading all dependent cookbooks from Chef Supermarket.

Run `berks install`.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/awesome_customers_windows
$ berks install
Resolving cookbook dependencies...
Fetching 'awesome_customers_windows' from source at .
Fetching cookbook index from https://supermarket.chef.io...
Installing sql_server (2.5.0)
Installing chef_handler (1.2.0)
Installing iis (4.1.6)
Installing openssl (4.4.0)
Using awesome_customers_windows (0.1.0) from source at .
Installing chef-sugar (3.3.0)
Installing windows (1.39.1)
```

Berkshelf installs dependent cookbooks to the <code class="file-path">~/.berkshelf/cookbooks</code> directory so that they can be shared among all of your cookbooks.

```bash
$ ls ~/.berkshelf/cookbooks
chef-sugar-3.3.0   iis-4.1.6          sql_server-2.5.0
chef_handler-1.2.0 openssl-4.4.0      windows-1.39.1
```

### Use Berkshelf to upload the cookbooks to the Chef server

Now we can upload your cookbooks to the Chef server.

Run `berks upload`.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/awesome_customers_windows
$ berks upload
Uploaded awesome_customers_windows (0.1.0) to: 'https://api.chef.io:443/organizations/your_org'
Uploaded chef_handler (1.2.0) to: 'https://api.chef.io:443/organizations/your_org'
Uploaded iis (4.1.6) to: 'https://api.chef.io:443/organizations/your_org'
Uploaded sql_server (2.5.0) to: 'https://api.chef.io:443/organizations/your_org'
Uploaded windows (1.39.1) to: 'https://api.chef.io:443/organizations/your_org'
```

[COMMENT] Berkshelf requires a trusted SSL certificate in order to upload cookbooks. If you're using your own Chef server, and not hosted Chef, you'll need to configure Chef server [to use a trusted SSL certificate](https://osxdominion.wordpress.com/2015/02/25/configuring-chef-server-12-to-use-trusted-ssl-certs/). The [Chef documentation](http://docs.chef.io/server_security.html#ssl-protocols) describes how Chef server works with SSL certificates.<br/><br/>Alternatively, for testing purposes you can run `berks upload --no-ssl-verify` to disable SSL verification.

### Verify that the upload process succeeded

To prove that the cookbooks uploaded successfully, run `knife cookbook list` from your <% fp '~/learn-chef' %> directory.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ knife cookbook list
awesome_customers_windows   0.1.0
chef_handler                1.2.0
iis                         4.1.6
sql_server                  2.5.0
windows                     1.39.1
```

Chef server now contains everything you need to run `chef-client` on your node.

## 5. Bootstrap your node

Now you can bootstrap your node. You'll specify the `awesome_customers_windows` cookbook's default recipe in the node's run-list, which will apply your web application configuration.

Now that you've verified that you can connect to your node over WinRM secured with SSL, copied your secret key to your node, and uploaded your encrypted data bag to Chef server, you're now ready to bootstrap your node.

First, from your workstation, make sure you're in the <code class="file-path">~/learn-chef</code> directory.

```bash
$ cd ~/learn-chef
```

Run this command to bootstrap your node. Replace <code class="placeholder">ADDRESS</code> with your remote node's external address, <code class="placeholder">USER</code> with your username, and <code class="placeholder">PASSWORD</code> with your password.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ knife bootstrap windows winrm ADDRESS --winrm-user USER --winrm-password 'PASSWORD' --node-name customers_web_app --run-list 'recipe[awesome_customers_windows]' --winrm-transport ssl --winrm-ssl-verify-mode verify_none 
```

Here's an example.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ knife bootstrap windows winrm ec2-52-36-120-7.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com --winrm-user Administrator --winrm-password 'R7dP$f(JN3' --node-name customers_web_app --run-list 'recipe[awesome_customers_windows]' --winrm-transport ssl --winrm-ssl-verify-mode verify_none
WARNING: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
SSL validation of HTTPS requests for the WinRM transport is disabled. HTTPS WinRM
connections are still encrypted, but knife is not able to detect forged replies
or spoofing attacks.

To fix this issue add an entry like this to your knife configuration file:

``
  # Verify all WinRM HTTPS connections (default, recommended)
  knife[:winrm_ssl_verify_mode] = :verify_peer
``

## 6. Verify the configuration

From a browser on your workstation, navigate to your site's /Products/Customers.aspx page, for example, http://52.36.120.7/Products/Customers.aspx. You'll see this:

![](misc/manage_customers_node_windows.png)

In this part, you uploaded your data bag and cookbooks to Chef server and then boostrapped your node. Later, [check out this appendix](/manage-a-web-app/windows/updating-your-nodes-configuration/) to read about some ways to update your node's configuration.

## Clean up your environment

Perform these steps if you want to clean up your environment after you complete this tutorial or you want to repeat the process from the beginning.

### Remove the cookbooks from the Chef server

From your workstation, run the `knife cookbook list` command to list the cookbooks that exist on your Chef server.

Then run `knife cookbook delete <cookbook-name>` to delete any cookbooks you no longer want.

The [bulk delete](https://docs.chef.io/knife_cookbook.html#bulk-delete) option is an easy way to remove multiple cookbooks. For example, `knife cookbook bulk delete . -p` will entirely remove all cookbooks from your Chef server.

[WARN] Be sure not to remove any cookbooks that are used by other nodes in your network.

### Remove the cookbooks from your Berkshelf cache

Berkshelf installs dependent cookbooks to the <code class="file-path">~/.berkshelf/cookbooks</code> directory on your workstation so that they can be shared among all of your cookbooks.

From your workstation, you can remove individual cookbooks you no longer need from this directory, or remove them all like this.

```bash
$ rm -r ~/.berkshelf/cookbooks
```

### Delete the node from the Chef server

From your workstation, run these commands to delete the data about your node from the Chef server.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ knife node delete customers_web_app --yes
Deleted node[customers_web_app]
$ knife client delete customers_web_app --yes
Deleted client[customers_web_app]
```

### Tear down your node

Deleting a node from your Chef server removes any data about that node from the server &ndash; it doesn't automatically tear down the instance.

Don't forget to tear down any cloud instances that you used to complete the tutorial.
