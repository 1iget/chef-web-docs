Let's start by ensuring that Internet Information Services (IIS) is installed and that it's configured to run ASP.NET applications.

In [Learn the basics](/learn-the-basics/windows/) and [Manage a node](/manage-a-node/windows/), you wrote a basic IIS cookbook from scratch. You used the `powershell_script` resource, like this.

```ruby
# ~\chef-repo\webserver.rb
powershell_script 'Install IIS' do
  code 'Add-WindowsFeature Web-Server'
  guard_interpreter :powershell_script
  not_if "(Get-WindowsFeature -Name Web-Server).Installed"
end
```

For this project, we'll use the [windows](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/windows) cookbook from Chef Supermarket. The `windows` cookbook provides a number of custom Chef resources that perform common tasks on Windows. Specifically, we'll use the `windows_feature` to work with Windows roles and features.

Remember that Chef Supermarket is a place for the community to share cookbooks. In [Manage a node](/manage-a-node/windows/), you downloaded the Learn Chef IIS cookbook so you didn't have to type it in a second time. The `windows` cookbook on Chef Supermarket works in a similar way &ndash; it contains reusable components so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

[COMMENT] Remember, when using cookbooks from Chef Supermarket, always evaluate the code to ensure that it does exactly what you expect. It's a common practice to download a cookbook from Supermarket and modify it to suit your organization's specific requirements. If you find a way to improve a cookbook that others can benefit from, we hope you'll [become a contributor](https://supermarket.chef.io/become-a-contributor)!
