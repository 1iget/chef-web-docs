In this part, you'll configure the web app that reads the records from your SQL Server database and displays them on the web page.

Specifically, you'll perform these tasks:

1. Disable the default IIS web site.
1. Download an unpack a prebuilt version of the ASP.NET Customers web app.
1. Create an IIS app pool, app, and site [to run your web application on].
1. Grant access to the IIS_IUSRS group to query the `customers` table in the `learnchef` database.

You'll be working in the <code class="file-path">webserver.rb</code> and <code class="file-path">database.rb</code> recipes that you created earlier.

You've done most of the ground work &ndash; for example you've already set up IIS, ASP.NET, and a SQL Server database. We'll start by XxX.
