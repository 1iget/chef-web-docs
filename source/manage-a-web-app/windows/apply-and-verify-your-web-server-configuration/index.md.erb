So far, our cookbook ensures that IIS, ASP.NET, and the IIS Management Console are enabled.

Before we configure SQL Server, our database instance, and the web application, let's upload your work to the Chef server, bootstrap your node, and verify that everything is working as expected.

By verifying things incrementally, we can fix problems, build confidence that your cookbook works as expected, and make adjustments.
