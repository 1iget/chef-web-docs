That that we've written code to configure SQL Server, let's create a database, a table, and add sample rows to the table so we can test that the web application works.

To do so, we'll add SQL commands to a file in our cookbook and copy that script file to a working directory and run it when the cookbook runs. Each step will implement Chef's test and repair mechanism to ensure that it is applied only when needed.
