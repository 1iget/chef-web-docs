## 1. Download the installer to a shared location on your network

Download `Express 64BIT\SQLEXPR_x64_ENU.exe` from the Microsoft Download Center to a [shared location](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc770880.aspx) on your network that your node can access.

[COMMENT] If you don't have a shared location available, you can create a share on your Windows Server node and download the installer to that location.
