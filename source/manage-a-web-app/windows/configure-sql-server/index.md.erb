Now let's configure Microsoft SQL Server. For this tutorial, we'll use Microsoft SQL Server Express 2014.

A common way to install SQL Server is to first manually download the installer to a location on your network. Then from the computer you want to install SQL Server on, you mount the network location as a drive and run the installer.

Because we require an unattended installation, that is, one that uses automation, we'll run the installer in quiet mode and provide a configuration file that lists our required configuration parameters.

1. Download installer to a shared location on your network
2. Create a configuration file
3. Mount the shared network location
4. Run the installer
5. Unmount the shared network location
