Now let's configure Microsoft SQL Server. You'll install the SQL Server and client packages and start the service.

A common way to install SQL Server is to manually download the installer to a location on your network and install it from that location.

For this tutorial, we'll use Microsoft SQL Server Express 2014.


1. Download installer to a shared location on your network
2. Create a configuration file
3. Mount the shared network location
4. Run the installer
5. Unmount the shared network location
