In this tutorial, you set up a basic yet complete LAMP, or WISA, stack on Windows Server that includes IIS web server, a SQL Server database, and ASP.NET code. You used many of the skills you've already learned, such as how to write a cookbook, upload it to the Chef server, and run it multiple times on your bootstrapped node. But this scenario introduced just enough complexity to demonstrate many Chef usage patterns, such as how to use Berkshelf to manage cookbook dependencies.

[GITHUB] Get the final version of the `awesome_customers` cookbook on [GitHub](https://github.com/learn-chef/manage-a-web-app-windows).

In the next tutorial, [Learn to develop your Windows Server infrastructure code locally](/local-development/windows/), you'll learn how to speed up the development cycle by using Test Kitchen to configure your web application on a temporary virtual machine or cloud instance.
