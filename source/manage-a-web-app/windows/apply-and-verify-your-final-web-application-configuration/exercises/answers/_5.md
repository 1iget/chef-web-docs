You already accomplished the majority of the tasks that you need. You wrote the `awesome_customers` cookbook, uploaded it and its dependent cookbooks to the Chef server, applied the `awesome_customers` cookbook to your node, and verified that everything's working.

All you need to do now is:

1. [Bring up a second](/manage-a-web-app/windows/get-set-up#step2) Windows Server node.
1. [Bootstrap your node](/manage-a-web-app/windows/apply-and-verify-your-web-server-configuration#step3). Be sure to give your node a name other than `web_app_windows` (for example, `web_app_windows2`) because that name already exists. Also, because of the complications that are introduced by installing SQL Server over WinRM, omit the `--run-list` part of the command so that no cookbooks are run during the boostrap process.

    ```bash
    $ knife bootstrap windows winrm ADDRESS --winrm-user USER --winrm-password 'PASSWORD' --node-name web_app_windows2
    ```

1. Run [knife node run_list add](https://docs.chef.io/knife_node.html#run-list-add) to add the `awesome_customers` cookbook to the node's run-list.

    ```bash
    $ knife node run_list add web_app_windows2 'recipe[awesome_customers]'
    web_app_windows:
      run_list: recipe[awesome_customers]
    ```

1. Connect to your node and run `chef-client`.

The result is a second node that's configured identically to the first one. The process should take far less time because you already did most of the work.

Now when you fix an issue or add a new feature, you'll be able to deploy and verify your update much more quickly!
