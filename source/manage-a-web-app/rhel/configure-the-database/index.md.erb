Now let's configure a database instance named `products`. You'll also assign a user to the database, create a table to hold customer data, and fill the table with some sample data.

For this part we'll use the [database](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/database) cookbook from Chef Supermarket, which enables us to configure our MySQL database instance.
