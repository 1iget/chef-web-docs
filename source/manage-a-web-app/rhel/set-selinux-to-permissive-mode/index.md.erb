Enforcing your organization's security requirements is important. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS, [Security-Enhanced Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux), or SELinux, is enabled by default. For learning purposes, we'll relax system security so we don't have to deal with the complexity it introduces.

In this part, you'll use the [selinux](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/selinux) cookbook from Chef Supermarket to set SELinux to permissive mode. Under permissive mode, SELinux is enabled, meaning it will log security violations, but it will not enforce restricted policies.
