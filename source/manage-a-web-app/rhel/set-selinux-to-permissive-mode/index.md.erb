Enforcing your organization's security requirements is important. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS, [Security-Enhanced Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux), or SELinux, is enabled by default. For learning purposes, we'll loosen the system's security enforcement so we don't have to deal with the complexity it introduces right now.

In this part, you'll use the [selinux](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/selinux) cookbook from Chef Supermarket to set SELinux to permissive mode. Under permissive mode, SELinux is enabled, meaning it will log security violations, but it will not enforce restricted policies.
