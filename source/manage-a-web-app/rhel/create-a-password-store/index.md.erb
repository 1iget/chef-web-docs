The next thing we want to do is configure MySQL and our database instance. That step involves setting passwords for MySQL and the database instance. Before we set up the database, let's create a way to securely store the password so that only our node can access it.

For this part, we'll use an [encrypted data bag](https://docs.chef.io/chef/essentials_data_bags.html). A _data bag_ stores data as a series of key-value pairs. An item in a data bag is similar to a node attribute. However, a data bag can be shared among nodes, whereas a node attribute belongs to just one node and can't be shared.

An _encypted data bag_ is a data bag that uses [shared secret encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm) to protect confidential information such as certificates, API keys, and in our case, passwords.

In this part, you'll generate a secret key that's used to encrypt data, create an encrypted data bag to hold your passwords, and create a test data bag item to ensure that everything's working. You'll create the data bag items for your database passwords in the next part.
