Now let's configure the firewall. You need inbound access on port 22 (SSH) so that you can run `chef-client` remotely from your workstation and so that you can log in and verify that your server is configured as we expect. You also need inbound access on port 80 (HTTP) so users can access your web site.

The easiest way to set firewall rules is to use the [iptables](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/iptables) cookbook from Chef Supermarket.
