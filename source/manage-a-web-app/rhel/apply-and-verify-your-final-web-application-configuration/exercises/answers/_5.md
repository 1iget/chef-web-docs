You already accomplished the majority of the tasks that you need. You wrote the `awesome_customers` cookbook, uploaded it and its dependent cookbooks to the Chef server, applied the `awesome_customers` cookbook to your node, and verified that everything's working.

All you need to do now is:

1. [Bring up a second](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/apply-and-verify-your-web-server-configuration#2getanodetobootstrap) Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS node.
1. [Bootstrap your node](/manage-a-web-app/rhel/apply-and-verify-your-web-server-configuration#3bootstrapyournode) the same way as before. Because you include the `awesome_customers` cookbook in your run-list, your node will apply that cookbook during the bootstrap process.

The result is a second node that's configured identically to the first one. The process should take far less time because you already did most of the work.

Now when you fix an issue or add a new feature, you'll be able to deploy and verify your update much more quickly!
