[HEADLINE] Your node requires a copy of the secret key file to decrypt the password from the data bag.

Now let's configure MySQL. You'll install the MySQL server and client packages and start the service.

For this part, we'll use these cookbooks from Chef Supermarket:

| Cookbook           | Description |
|-------------------:|-------------|
| [mysql2\_chef\_gem](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/mysql2_chef_gem) | installs the `mysql2` Ruby gem, which enables your Chef code to communicate with MySQL. |
| [mysql](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/mysql) | enables us to configure the MySQL server and client packages. |
