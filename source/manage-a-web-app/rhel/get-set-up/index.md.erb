To complete this tutorial, you'll need three things &dash; the Chef development kit (Chef DK) installed on your workstation, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS node to manage, and a hosted Chef account.

You'll also create a Chef code repository and a blank cookbook on your workstation to set up your web application project.
