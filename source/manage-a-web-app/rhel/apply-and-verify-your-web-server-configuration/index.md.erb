[HEADLINE] Berkshelf helps you manage dependencies among your cookbooks. It uploads your cookbooks to the Chef server and retrieves the cookbooks that your cookbook depends on.

So far, our cookbook creates the `web_admin` user and group and configures an Apache web server.

Before we configure the MySQL database or PHP parts of your project, let's upload your work to the Chef server, bootstrap your node, and verify that everything is working as expected.

By verifying things incrementally, we can fix problems, build confidence that your cookbook works as expected, and make adjustments.
