[HEADLINE] Specifying, or _pinning_, the cookbook version helps you lock down functionality to a certain point in time. When a newer version of a cookbook is released, you can first verify and test that version before you deploy it to production.

Now let's configure Apache. Here you'll install the Apache package, start its service, create and enable our custom site, and create a default home page for our site.

In [Learn the basics](/learn-the-basics/rhel) and [Learn to manage a node](/manage-a-node/rhel/), you wrote a basic Apache cookbook from scratch. For this project, we want to leverage additional Apache features, which would take some effort to set up.

That's where the [httpd](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/httpd) cookbook on Chef Supermarket comes in. The `httpd` cookbook provides common functionality such as setting up virtual hosting so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

Remember that Chef Supermarket is a place for the community to share cookbooks. In [Learn to manage a node](/manage-a-node/rhel/), you downloaded the Learn Chef Apache cookbook so you didn't have to type it in a second time. The `httpd` cookbook on Chef Supermarket contains everything we need to set up our web site.

[COMMENT] Keep in mind that for now your goal is to learn how Chef works. It's OK if you don't understand every detail of how the community cookbooks work because you're working in a safe environment. As you gain experience, you'll want to evaluate the code and documentation to ensure that the cookbooks you get from Chef Supermarket do exactly what you expect before you apply them to your production environment.
