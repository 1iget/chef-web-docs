## 1. Install the Chef Development Kit on your workstation

You administer your network with your workstation. Your workstation is also where you write your Chef code. Remember that although you'll be configuring an Ubuntu machine, your workstation can be any OS you choose &ndash; be it Linux, Mac OS, or Windows.

[COMMENT] It's common to use a virtual machine as your workstation. Just make sure your VM meets the [system requirements](https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html#review-prerequisites).

Install Chef DK on your workstation now if you haven't already.

[COMMENT] The [Chef documentation](https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html) describes additional steps that can help you set up your workstation to use Chef more effectively. You don't have to perform all the steps now, but you can refer to it later if you run into problems. For example, if you're running multiple versions of Ruby, the documentation explains [how to use Chef's Ruby](https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html#set-system-ruby).
