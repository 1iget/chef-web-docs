## 1. Install the Chef Development Kit on your workstation

Your workstation is the computer from where you administer your network. It's also the place where you write your Chef code. Remember that although you'll be configuring an Ubuntu machine, your workstation can be any OS you choose &ndash; be it Linux, Mac OS, or Windows.

[COMMENT] It's common to use a virtual machine as your workstation. Just make sure your VM meets the [system requirements](https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html#review-prerequisites).

Install Chef Development Kit (ChefDK) on your workstation now if you don't have it already.
