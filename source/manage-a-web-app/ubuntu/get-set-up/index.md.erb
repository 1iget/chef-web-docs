To complete this tutorial, you'll need three things &dash; the Chef Development Kit (Chef DK) installed on your workstation, an Ubuntu node to manage, and a hosted Chef account.

You'll also create a Chef code repository and a blank cookbook on your workstation to set up your web application project.
