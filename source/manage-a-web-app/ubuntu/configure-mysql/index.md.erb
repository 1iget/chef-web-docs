Now let's configure MySQL. Here you'll install the MySQL server and client packages and start its service.

For this part, we'll use these cookbooks from Chef Supermarket:

| Cookbook           | Description |
|-------------------:|-------------|
| [mysql2\_chef\_gem](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/mysql2_chef_gem) | installs the `mysql2` Ruby gem, which enables our Chef code to communicate with MySQL. |
| [mysql](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/mysql) | enables us to configure the MySQL server and client packages. |
