In this part, you'll configure PHP and create a basic PHP app that reads the records from your MySQL database and displays them on the web page. You'll be working in the <code class="file-path">webserver.rb</code> recipe that you created when you set up Apache.

You've done most of the ground work &ndash; for example you've already set up a place to hold your custom site and you've opened up port 80 to incoming traffic.

To configure PHP, you're going to install the native `php5-mysql` package, which enables PHP code to connect to MySQL databases. You'll first install the `mod_php5` Apache module, which enables Apache to interpret PHP files.
