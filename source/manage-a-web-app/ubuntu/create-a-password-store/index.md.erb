The next thing we want to do is configure MySQL and our database instance. That step involves working with two passwords &ndash; one for the root MySQL account and for the the database instance.

Before we set up the database, let's create a way to securely store the passwords so that only our node can access it.

For this part, we'll use an [encrypted data bag](https://docs.chef.io/chef/essentials_data_bags.html). A _data bag_ stores data as a series of key-value pairs. An item in a data bag is similar to a node attribute. However, a data bag can be shared among nodes, whereas a node attribute belongs to just one node and can't be shared.

An _encypted data bag_ is a data bag that uses [shared secret encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm) to protect confidential information such as certificates, API keys, and in our case, passwords.

In this part, you'll generate a secret key that's used to encrypt data, create an encrypted data bag to hold your passwords, and create two data bag items &ndash; one for each password.
