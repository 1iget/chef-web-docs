A common requirement is to ensure that the package manager cache &ndash; Ubuntu's built-in package manager is named `apt` &ndash; is up to date before installing Apache, MySQL, or any other packages. This step synchronizes the system's package index to the latest list of what packages are available.

You could add code to your cookbook that runs `apt-get update` every time `chef-client` runs on your node. But writing a cookbook is an iterative process. You'll run it multiple times as you experiment, add features, fix problems, and so on. You don't necessarily want to update the `apt` cache every time you run your cookbook because the process can take some time to complete.

That's where the [apt](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/apt) cookbook on Chef Supermarket comes in. The `apt` cookbook updates the `apt` cache only on the first run, and every 24 hours thereafter. You can modify these defaults if you need to.

Remember that Chef Supermarket is a place for the community to share cookbooks. In [Manage a node](/manage-a-node/ubuntu/), you downloaded the Learn Chef Apache cookbook so you didn't have to type it in a second time. The `apt` cookbook on Chef Supermarket contains everything you need to keep the `apt` cache up-to-date.

[COMMENT] Remember, when using cookbooks from Chef Supermarket, always evaluate the code to ensure that it does exactly what you expect. It's a common practice to download a cookbook from Supermarket and modify it to suit your organization's specific requirements. If you find a way to improve a cookbook that others can benefit from, we hope you'll [become a contributor](https://supermarket.chef.io/become-a-contributor)!
