So far, our cookbook ensures that the `apt` cache stays up to date, creates the `web_admin` user and group, and configures Apache web server.

Before we configure the MySQL database or PHP parts of our project, let's upload our work to the Chef server, bootstrap our node, and verify that everything is working as expected.

By verifying things incrementally, we can build confidence that our cookbook works as expected, fix problems, and make adjustments.
