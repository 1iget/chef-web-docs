WARNING: There are invalid certificates in your trusted_certs_dir.
OpenSSL will not use the following certificates when verifying SSL connections:

/home/ubuntu/learn-chef/.chef/trusted_certs/AWS_OpsWorks_Intermediate_CA_for_GAMMA.crt: unable to get local issuer certificate
/home/ubuntu/learn-chef/.chef/trusted_certs/test4-qjewjevyiek4zdkq.crt: unable to get local issuer certificate


TO FIX THESE WARNINGS:

We are working on documentation for resolving common issues uncovered here.

* If the certificate is generated by the server, you may try redownloading the
server's certificate. By default, the certificate is stored in the following
location on the host where your chef-server runs:

  /var/opt/opscode/nginx/ca/SERVER_HOSTNAME.crt

Copy that file to your trusted_certs_dir (currently: /home/ubuntu/learn-chef/.chef/trusted_certs)
using SSH/SCP or some other secure method, then re-run this command to confirm
that the server's certificate is now trusted.
